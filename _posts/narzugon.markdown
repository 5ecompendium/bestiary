***Diabolical Sense.*** The narzugon has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks made to perceive good-aligned creatures.

***Infernal Tack.*** The narzugon wears spurs that are part of infernal tack, which allow it to summon its nightmare companion.

***Magic Resistance.*** The narzugon has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Actions**

***Multiattack*** The narzugon uses its Infernal Command or Terrifying Command. It also makes three hellfire lance attacks.

***Hellfire Lance*** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (1d12 + 5) piercing damage plus 16 (3d10) fire damage. If this damage kills a creature, the creature's soul rises from the River Styx as a lemure in Avernus in 1d4 hours.
If the creature isn't revived before then, only a wish spell or killing the lemure and casting true resurrection on the creature's original body can restore it to life. Constructs and devils are immune to this effect.

***Infernal Command*** Each ally of the narzugon within 60 feet of it can't be charmed or frightened until the end of the narzugon's next turn.

***Terrifying Command*** Each creature that isn't a fiend within 60 feet of the narzugon that can hear it must succeed on a DC 17 Charisma saving throw or become frightened of it for 1 minute.
A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that makes a successful saving throw is immune to this narzugon's Terrifying Command for 24 hours.

***Healing (1/Day)*** The narzugon, or one creature it touches, regains up to 100 hit points.
