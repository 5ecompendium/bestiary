***Unyielding.*** When the priest is subjected to an effect that would move it, knock it prone, or both, it can use its reaction to be neither moved nor knocked prone.

The priests of the Black Earth have developed a twisted dogma to explain how the evil of elemental earth is destined to remake the world and rule over all.
