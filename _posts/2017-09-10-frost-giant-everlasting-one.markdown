***Regeneration.*** The giant regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn. If the giant takes acid or fire damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of its next turn. The giant dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.

***Vaprak's Rage (Recharges on a Short or Long Rest).*** As a bonus action, the giant can enter a rage at the start of its turn. The rage lasts for 1 minute or until the giant is incapacitated. While raging, the giant gains the following benefits:

- The giant has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws

- When it makes a melee weapon attack, the giant gains a +4 bonus to the damage roll.

- The giant has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
