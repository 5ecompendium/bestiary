***Undead Nature.*** A death knight doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

***Magic Resistance.*** The death knight has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Marshal Undead.*** Unless the death knight is incapacitated, it and undead creatures of its choice within 60 feet of it have advantage on saving throws against features that turn undead.

***Spellcasting.*** The death knight is a 19th-level spell caster. Its spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 18, +10 to hit with spell attacks). It has the following paladin spells prepared: 

* 1st level (4 slots): command, compelled duel, searing smite

* 2nd level (3 slots): hold person, magic weapon

* 3rd level (3 slots): dispel magic, elemental weapon

* 4th level (3 slots): banishment, staggering smite

* 5th level (2 slots): destructive wave (necrotic)

**Actions**

***Multiattack.*** The death knight makes three longsword attacks.

***Longsword.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d8 + 5) slashing damage, or 10 (1d10 + 5) slashing damage if used with two hands, plus 18 (4d8) necrotic damage.

***Hellfire Orb (1/day).*** The death knight hurls a magical ball of fire that explodes at a point it can see within 120 feet of it. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. The sphere spreads around corners. A creature takes 35 (10d6) fire damage and 35 (10d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Reactions**

***Parry.*** The death knight adds 6 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the death knight must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
