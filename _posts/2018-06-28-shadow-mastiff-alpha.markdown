***Ethereal Awareness.*** The shadow mastiff can see ethereal creatures and objects.

***Keen Hearing and Smell.*** The shadow mastiff has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.

***Shadow Blend.*** While in dim light or darkness, the shadow mastiff can use a bonus action to become invisible, along with anything it is wearing or carrying. The invisibility lasts until the shadow mastiff uses a bonus action to end it or until the shadow mastiff attacks, is in bright light, or is incapacitated.

***Sunlight Weakness.*** While in bright light created by sunlight, the shadow mastiff has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.

**Actions**

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6+3) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

***Terrifying Howl*** The shadow mastiff howls. Any beast or humanoid within 300 feet of the mastiff and able to to hear its howl must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to any shadow mastiff's Terrifying Howl for the next 24 hours.
