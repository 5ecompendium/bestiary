**Actions**

***Multiattack*** The drow makes three scimitar attacks.

***Scimitar*** Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d6 + 5) slashing damage plus 18 (4d8) poison damage. In addition, the target has disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes against a spell the drow casts before the end of the drow's next turn.

***Hand Crossbow*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d6 + 5) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is also unconscious while poisoned in this way. The target regains consciousness if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it.
