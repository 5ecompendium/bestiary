***Innate Spellcasting.*** Geryon's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma. He can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:
* At will: alter self (can become Medium when changing his appearance), detect magic, geas, ice storm, invisibility (self only), locate object, suggestion, wall of ice
* 1/day each: divine word, symbol (pain only)

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Geryon fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** Geryon has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Magic Weapons.*** Geryon's weapon attacks are magical.

***Regeneration.*** Geryon regains 20 hit points at the start of his turn. If he takes radiant damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of his next turn. Geryon dies only if he starts his turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.

**Actions**

***Multiattack*** Geryon makes two attacks: one with his claws and one with his stinger.

***Claws*** Melee Weapon Attack: +16 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 23 (4d6 + 9) slashing damage. If the target is Large or smaller, it is grappled (DC 24) and is restrained until the grapple ends. Geryon can grapple one creature at a time. If the target is already grappled by Geryon, the target takes an extra 27 (6d8) slashing damage.

***Stinger*** Melee Weapon Attack: +16 to hit, reach 20 ft., one creature. Hit: 14 (2d4 + 9) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or take 13 (2d12) poison damage and become poisoned until it finishes a short or long rest. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to half the poison damage it takes. If its hit point maximum drops to 0, it dies. This reduction lasts until the poisoned condition is removed.

***Teleport*** Geryon magically teleports, along with any equipment he is wearing and carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space he can see.

***Sound the Horn (1/Day)*** Geryon blows his horn, which causes 5d4 minotaurs to appear in unoccupied spaces of his choice within 600 feet of him. The minotaurs roll initiative when they appear. They remain until they die or Geryon uses an action to dismiss any or all of them.

**Legendary Actions**

Geryon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Geryon regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

***Infernal Glare*** Geryon targets one creature he can see within 60 feet of him. If the target can see Geryon, the target must succeed on a DC 23 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of Geryon until the end of its next turn.

***Swift Sting (Costs 2 Actions)*** Geryon attacks with his stinger.

***Teleport*** Geryon uses his Teleport action.
