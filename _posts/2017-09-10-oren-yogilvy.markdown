***Roleplaying Information.*** Oren came to Nurthfurrow's End looking for easy work and found it. He sings for his supper, drinks like a fish, and wanders the fields at night dreaming up new lyrics to entertain the inn's other guests. Oren likes to stir up trouble from time to time, but he doesn't  have a mean bone in his body.
