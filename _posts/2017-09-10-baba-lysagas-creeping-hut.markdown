***Constructed Nature.*** An animated object doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

>The magic that animates an object is dispelled when the construct drops to 0 hit points. An animated object reduced to 0 hit points becomes inanimate and is too damaged to be of much use or value to anyone.

***Antimagic Susceptibility.*** The hut is incapacitated while the magic gem that animates it is in the area of an antimagic field. If targeted by dispel magic, the hut must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against the caster's spell save DC or fall unconscious for 1 minute.

***Siege Monster.*** The hut deals double damage to objects and structures.

**Actions**

***Multiattack.*** The hut makes three attacks with its roots. It can replace one of these attacks with a rock attack.

***Root.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 60 ft., one target. Hit: 30 (4d10+8) bludgeoning damage.

***Rock.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 21 (3d8+8) bludegoning damage.
