***Duergar Resilience.*** The spy has advantage on saving throws against poison, spells, and illusions, as well as to resist being charmed or paralyzed.

***Sneak Attack.*** Once per turn, the spy can deal an extra 7 (2d6) damage when it hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of the spy that isn't incapacitated and the spy doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** While in sunlight, the spy has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

***Eniarge (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** For 1 minute, the spy magically increases in size, along with anything it is wearing or carrying.

Any equipment the spy wears or carries is invisible with it.
