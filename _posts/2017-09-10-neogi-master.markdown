***Mental Fortitude.*** The neogi has advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened, and magic can't put the neogi to sleep.

***Spellcasting.*** The neogi is a 7th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks). It regains its expended spell slots when it finishes a short or long rest. It knows the following warlock spells:

Cantrips (at will): eldritch blast (range 300 ft., +4 bonus to each damage roll), guidance, mage hand, minor illusion, prestidigitation, vicious mockery

1st-4th level (2 4th-level slots): arms of Hadar, counterspell, dimension door, fear, hold person, hunger of Hadar, invisibility, unseen servant

***Spider Climb.*** The neogi can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

**Actions**

***Multiattack.*** The neogi makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claws.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 it, one target. Hit: 6 (1d6+3) piercing damage plus 14 (4d6) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (2d4+3) slashing damage.

***Enslave (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** The neogi targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be magically  charmed by the neogi for 1 day, or until the neogi dies or is more than 1 mile from the target. The charmed target obeys the neogi's commands and can't take reactions, and the neogi and the target can communicate telepathically with each other at a distance of up to 1 mile. Whenever the charmed target takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
