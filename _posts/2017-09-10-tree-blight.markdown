***False Appearance.*** While the blight remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a dead tree.

***Siege Monster.*** The blight deals double damage to objects and structures.

**Actions**

***Multiattack.*** The blight makes four attacks: two with its branches and two with its grasping roots, If it has a target grappled, the blight can also make a bite attack against the target as a bonus action.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (3d8+6) piercing damage.

***Branch.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit (3d6+6) bludgeoning damage.

***Grasping Root.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 15 ft., one creature not grappled by the blight. Hit: the target is grappled (escape DC 15). Until the grapple ends, the target takes 9 (1d6+6) bludgeoning damage at the start of each of its turns. The root has AC 15 and can be severed by dealing 6 slashing damage or more to it at once. Cutting the root doesn't hurt the blight but ends the grapple.
