***Unarmored Defense.*** While Zi is wearing no armor and wielding no shield, her AC includes her Wisdom modifier.

***Roleplaying Information.*** Zi Liang is a devout worshiper of Chauntea, the Earth Mother. She has considerably less faith in Goldenfields' defenders, so she patrols the temple-farm during her off-duty hours.

Ideal: "If we faithfully tend to our gardens and our fields, Chauntea will smile upon us."

Bond: "Goldenfields is the breadbasket of the North. People depend on its safety and prosperity, and I'll do what must be done to protect it."

Flaw: "I don't trust authority. I do what my heart says is right."

**Actions**

***Multiattack.*** Zi makes two melee attacks.

***Quarterstaff.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d6+1) bludgeoning damage, or 5 (1d8+1) bludgeoning damage if used with both hands.

***Sling.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d4+2) bludgeoning damage. Zi carries twenty sling stones.
