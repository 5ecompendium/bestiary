***Life Drain.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 20 (5d6 + 3) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

***Longsword.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d8 + 5) slashing damage, or 10 (1d10 + 5) if used with two hands, plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage.
