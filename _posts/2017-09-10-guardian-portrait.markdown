***Constructed Nature.*** An animated object doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

>The magic that animates an object is dispelled when the construct drops to 0 hit points. An animated object reduced to 0 hit points becomes inanimate and is too damaged to be of much use or value to anyone.

***Antimagic Susceptibility.*** The portrait is incapacitated while in the area of an antimagic field. If targeted by dispel magic, the portrait must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against the caster's spell save DC or fall unconscious for 1 minute.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The portrait's innate spellcasting ability os Intelligence (spell save DC 12). The portrait can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

>3/day each: counterspell, crown of madness, hypnotic pattern, telekinesis

***False Appearance.*** While the figure in the portrait remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal painting.
