***Keen Smell.*** The catoblepas has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.

***Stench.*** Any creature other than a catoblepas that starts its turn within 10 feet of the catoblepas must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of the creature's next turn. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to the stench of any catoblepas for 1 hour.

**Actions**

***Tail.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 21 (5d6+4) bludgeoning damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the start of the catoblepas's next turn.

***Death Ray (Recharge 5-6).*** The catoblepas targets a creature that it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target instead takes 64 necrotic damage. The target dies if reduced to 0 hit points by this ray.
