***Keen Smell.*** The giant has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The giant's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma. It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components: 

At will: detect magic, fog cloud, light

3/day each: feather fall, fly, misty step, telekinesis

1/day each: control weather, gaseous form

**Actions**

***Fling.*** The giant tries to throw a Small or Medium creature within 10 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or be hurled up to 60 feet horizontally in a direction of the giant's choice and land prone, taking 1d8 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown.

***Wind Aura.*** A magical aura of wind surrounds the giant. The aura is a 10-foot-radius sphere that lasts as long as the giant maintains concentration on it (as if concentrating on a spell). While the aura is in effect, the giant gains a +2 bonus to its AC against ranged weapon attacks, and all open flames within the aura are extinguished unless they are magical.

***Multiattack.*** The giant makes two morningstar attacks.

***Morningstar.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 21 (3d8 + 8) piercing damage.

***Rock.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. Hit: 30 (4d10 + 8) bludgeoning damage.
