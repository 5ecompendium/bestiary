***Trampling Charge.*** If the ngobou moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a gore attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the ngobou can make one stomp attack against it as a bonus action.

***Elephants' Bane.*** The ngobou has advantage on attacks against elephants. It can detect by scent whether an elephant has been within 180 feet of its location anytime in the last 48 hours.

***Spikes.*** A creature that grapples an ngobou takes 9 (2d8) piercing damage.
