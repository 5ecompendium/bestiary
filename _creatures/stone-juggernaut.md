***Devastating Roll.*** The juggernaut can move through the space of a prone creature. A creature whoses pace the juggernaut enters for the first time on a turn must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 55 (lOdlO) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Immutable Form.*** The juggernaut is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.

***Regeneration.*** As long as it has 1 hit point left, the juggernaut magically regains all its hit points daily at dawn. The juggernaut is destroyed and does not regenerate if it drops to 0 hit points.

***Siege Monster.*** The juggernaut deals double damage to objects and structures.

### Actions

***Slam.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 25 (3dl2 +6) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
