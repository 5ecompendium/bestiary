***Undead Fortitude.*** If damage reduces the zombie to 0
hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw
with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage
is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the
zombie drops to 1 hit point instead.

***Aggressive.*** As a bonus action, the zombie can move up
to half its speed toward a hostile creature it can see.

### Actions

***Ravage.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5ft., one
target. Hit: 6 (1d8 + 2) slashing damage.
