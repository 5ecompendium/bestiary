***Death Throes.*** When a stench beetle dies, it explodes in a rush of
effluvium of nauseating fluids and gases in a 10-foot radius. Creatures
within that radius must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be
poisoned for 1 minute. While poisoned, the creature can only take one
action or bonus action on its turn as it spends the rest of its turn retching.
A poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of
its turns, ending the effect on a success.

### Actions

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (2d4 + 1) piercing damage.
