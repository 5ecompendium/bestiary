***Dreadful.*** Bael can use a bonus action to appear dreadful until the start of his next turn. Each creature, other than a devil, that starts its turn within 10 feet of Bael must succeed on a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the start of the creature's next turn.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** Bael's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma. He can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:
* At will: alter self (can become Medium when changing his appearance), animate dead, charm person, detect magic, inflict wounds (as an 8th-level spell), invisibility (self only), major image
* 3/day each: counterspell, dispel magic, fly, suggestion, wall of fire
* 1/day each: dominate monster, symbol (stunning only)

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Bael fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** Bael has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Magic Weapons.*** Bael's weapon attacks are magical.
