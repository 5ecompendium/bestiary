***Magic Resistance.*** The pixie has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The pixie's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 12). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring only its pixie dust as a component:

* At will: <i>druidcraft</i>

* 1/day each: <i>confusion, dancing lights, detect evil and good, detect thoughts, dispel magic, entangle, fly, phantasmal force, polymorph, sleep</i>

### Actions

***Superior Invisibility.*** The pixie magically turns invisible until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment the pixie wears or carries is invisible with it.
