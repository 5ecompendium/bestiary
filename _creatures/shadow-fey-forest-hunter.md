3/day: misty step (when in shadows, dim light, or darkness only)

***Sneak Attack (1/turn).*** The shadow fey forest hunter does an extra 7 (2d6) damage when it hits a target with a weapon attack that had advantage, or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of the forest hunter that isn't incapacitated and the forest hunter doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll.
