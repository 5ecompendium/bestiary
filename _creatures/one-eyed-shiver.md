***Chilling Mist.*** While it is alive, the one-eyed shiver projects an aura of cold mist within 10 feet of itself. If the one-eyed shiver deals damage to a creature in this area, the creature also takes 5 (1d10) cold damage.

***Spellcasting.*** The one-eyed shiver is a 5th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 13, +5 to hit with spell attacks). It knows the following sorcerer spells:

* Cantrips (at will): <i>chill touch, mage hand</i>

* 1st level (4 slots): <i>fog cloud, mage armor, thunderwave</i>

* 2nd level (3 slots): <i>mirror image, misty step</i>

* 3rd level (2 slots): <i>fear</i>

### Actions

***Dagger.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage.

***Eye of Frost.*** The one-eyed shiver casts ray of frost from its missing eye. If it hits, the target is also restrained. A target restrained in this way can end the condition by using an action, succeeding on a DC 13 Strength check.
