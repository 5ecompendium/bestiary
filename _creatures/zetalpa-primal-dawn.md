***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the elder dinosaur fails a saving
throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** The elder dinosaur has advantage on saving
throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Siege Monster.*** The elder dinosaur deals double damage to objects
and structures.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The elder dinosaur can use its Frightful Presence. It
then makes five attacks: one with its bite, two with its claws, and two
with its wings. It can use its Swallow instead of its bite.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +19 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 36
(4d12 + 10) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it is grappled
(escape DC 20). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and
the elder dinosaur can’t bite another target.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +19 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit:
28 (4d8 + 10) slashing damage.

***Wing.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +19 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit:
28 (4d8 + 10) bludgeoning damage.

***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of the elder dinosaur’s choice
within 120 feet of it and aware of it must succeed on a DC 17
Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature
can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with
disadvantage if the elder dinosaur is within line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful
or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the elder
dinosaur’s Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

***Swallow.*** The elder dinosaur makes one bite attack against a Large or
smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, that creature takes
the bite’s damage, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends.
While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total
cover against attacks and other effects outside the elder dinosaur,
and it takes 56 (16d6) acid damage at the start of each of the elder
dinosaur’s turns.

If the elder dinosaur takes 60 damage or more on a single turn
from a creature inside it, it must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution
saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed
creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of it. If the elder
dinosaur dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it
and can escape from the corpse by using 20 feet of movement,
exiting prone.

### Legendary Actions

The elder dinosaur can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from
the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used
at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The elder
dinosaur regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

***Attack.*** The elder dinosaur makes one claw attack, tail attack, wing
attack, or flipper attack.

***Move.*** The elder dinosaur moves up to half its speed.

***Chomp (Costs 2 Actions).*** The elder dinosaur makes one bite attack
or uses its Swallow.
