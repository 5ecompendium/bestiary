***Keen Smell.*** The mammoth has advantage on Wisdom (Perception)
checks that rely on smell.

***Charge.*** If the mammoth moves at least 20 feet straight toward a
creature and then hits it with a gore attack on the same turn, that target
must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If
the target is prone, the mammoth can make one stomp attack against it as
a bonus action.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The mammoth makes two attacks: one with its gore and
one with its slam.

***Gore.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 16
(3d6 + 6) piercing damage.

***Slam.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 15
(2d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage.

***Stomp.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 16
(3d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage.
