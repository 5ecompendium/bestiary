***Turning Defiance.*** The iron ghoul and any ghouls within 30 feet of it have advantage on saving throws against effects that turn undead.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The imperial ghoul makes one bite attack and one claws attack.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) piercing damage, and if the target creature is humanoid it must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or contract darakhul fever.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach, one target. Hit: 17 (4d6 + 3) slashing damage. If the target is a creature other than an elf or undead, it must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Light Crossbow.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 80/320, one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage.
