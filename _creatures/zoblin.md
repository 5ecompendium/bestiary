***Undead Fortitude.*** If damage reduces the zoblin to 0 hit
points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a
DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is
radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the zoblin
drops to 1 hit point instead.

### Actions

***Vicious Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach
5ft., one target. Hit: 3 (1d4 + 1) piercing damage, and
the zoblin attaches to the target. While attached, the
zoblin doesn’t attack. Instead, at the start of each of
the zoblin’s turns, that creature takes 5 (2d4) necrotic
damage. While the zoblin is attached, that creature’s
movement speed is also reduced by 10 ft. A creature
may use its action to make a DC 11 Athletics check,
prying the zoblin loose on a success.
