***Burrow.*** Dogmoles cannot burrow into solid rock, but they can move through softer material like soil or loose rubble, leaving a usable tunnel 5 feet in diameter.

***Wormkiller Rage.*** Wild dogmole packs are famed for their battles against monsters in the dark caverns of the world. If the dogmole draws blood against vermin, a purple worm, or other underground invertebrates, it gains a +4 boost to its Strength and Constitution, but suffers a -2 penalty to its AC. The wormkiller rage lasts for 3 rounds. It cannot end the rage voluntarily while the creatures that sent it into a rage still lives.
