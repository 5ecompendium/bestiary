***Headfirst Charge.*** The giff can try to knock a creature over; if the giff moves at least 20 feet in a straight line that ends within 5 feet of a Large or smaller creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or take 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone.

***Firearms Knowledge.*** The giff's mastery of its weapons enables it to ignore the loading property of muskets and pistols.

### Actions

***Multiattack*** The giff makes two pistol attacks.

***Longsword*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) slashing damage, or 9 (1d10 + 4) slashing damage if used with two hands.

***Musket*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 40/120 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d12 + 2) piercing damage.

***Pistol*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 30/90 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d10 + 2) piercing damage.

***Fragmentation Grenade (1/day)*** The giff throws a grenade up to 60 feet. Each creature within 20 feet of the grenade's detonation must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 17 (5d6) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
