### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The adept makes three unarmed strikes or three dart attacks.

***Unarmed Strike.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8+3) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, the adept can choose one of the following additional effects:

* The target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or drop one item it is holding (adept's choice).

* The target must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.

* The target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end ot'the adept's next turn.

***Dart.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 20/60 ft, one target. Hit: 5 (1d4+3) piercing damage.

### Reactions

***Deflect Missile.*** In response to being hit by a ranged weapon attack, the adept deflects the missile. The damage it takes from the attack is reduced by 1d10+3. If the damage is reduced to 0, the adept catches the missile if it's small enough to hold in one hand and the adept has a hand free.
