***Amphibious.*** The brine sea serpent can breathe air and water.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** A brine sea serpent attacks once with its bite and once
with its tail.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 21
(3d10 + 5) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) acid damage, and the target is
grappled (escape DC 18). If the brine sea serpent already has a creature
grappled with its bite, it can only bite that creature, and it has advantage
on that attack.

***Tail Slap.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit:
18 (3d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage and the target must succeed at a DC
18 Strength saving throw or be pushed 10 feet away and knocked prone.

***Brine Blast (Recharge 6).*** The brine serpent releases a 50-foot cone
of briny acid. Creatures in the area must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving
throw. On a failed saving throw, the target takes 72 (16d8) acid damage.

### Legendary Actions

The brine sea serpent can take up to 3 legendary actions, choosing from
the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time
and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The serpent regains spent
legendary actions at the start of its turn.

***Tail Attack.*** The brine serpent uses its tail attack.

***Coiling Maneuver (Costs 2 Actions).*** The brine sea serpent attempts to
grapple a Large or smaller target. The target must make a DC 18 Strength
saving throw or be grappled and restrained. The sea serpent can’t use its
other legendary actions or its Tail Slap if it’s grappling a target. At the
beginning of each of the brine serpent’s turns, the grappled target takes 18
(3d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage.
