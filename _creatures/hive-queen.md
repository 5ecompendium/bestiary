***Hivemind.*** All wasps within 10 miles of their queen
are in constant communication via a telepathic
bond.

### Actions

***Sting.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5ft.,
one target. Hit: 6 (1d4 + 4) piercing damage plus 2
poison damage for each giant wasp within 120 feet
that isnâ€™t incapacitated, and the target must
succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or
become poisoned for 1 minute. The target can
repeat this saving throw at the end of their turn,
ending the effect on a success.

***Command the Hive (Recharge 5-6).*** The queen gives
out a command to all wasps within 120 feet. They
may use their reaction to immediately move up to
half of their movement speed and attack a target if
able.

***Summon the Swarm (1/Day).*** The queen summons
four giant wasps in unoccupied spaces within 60
feet. These wasps last for 1 day, until the wasps die,
or until the queen dismisses them.
