***Amphibious.*** The hydrodemon can breathe air and water.

***Magic Resistance.*** The demon has advantage on saving throws against
spells and other magical effects.

***Magic Weapons.*** The demon’s weapon attacks are magical.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The hydrodemon’s spellcasting ability is Charisma
(spell save DC 13, +5 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the
following spells, requiring no material components:

* At will: <i>darkness, detect magic, water walk</i>

* 2/day each: <i>dimension door, teleport</i>

* 1/day each: <i>hallow</i>

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The hydrodemon makes three attacks: one with its bite
and two with its claws. The demon can use its Sleep Spittle instead of
using its bite.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13
(2d8 + 4) piercing damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 14).
Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and the demon can’t bite
another target.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 11
(2d6 + 4) slashing damage.

***Sleep Spittle.*** One target within 60 ft. must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom
saving throw or fall unconscious for 1 minute. The sleeping target can be
awakened if someone uses an action to shake or slap the sleeper awake,
and the target will wake if it takes damage.

***Summon (1/day).*** The demon chooses what to summon and attempts a
magical summoning.
A hydrodemon has a 30% chance of summoning one hydrodemon.
A summoned demon appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of
its summoner, acts as an ally of its summoner, and can’t summon other
demons. It remains for 1 minute, until it or its summoner dies, or until its
summoner dismisses it as an action.
