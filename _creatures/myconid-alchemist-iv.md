***Stalk-still.*** A myconid that remains perfectly still has advantage on
Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide.

### Actions

***Stone Knuckles.*** Melee weapon attack: +6 to hit. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3)
slashing damage.

***Spore Bomb.*** Ranged weapon attack: +4 to hit, range 30/60 ft. Hit: 15
(6d4) poison damage and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution
saving throw or be dominated for 1 minute. A dominated creature obeys
all commands telepathically delivered by the myconidâ€™s spores. Each
time the target takes damage it is allowed another saving throw.
