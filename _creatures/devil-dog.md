***Devil’s Sight.*** Magical darkness doesn’t impede the devil’s darkvision.

***Keen Smell.*** The devil dog has advantage on Wisdom (Perception)
checks that rely on smell.

***Magic Resistance.*** The devil has advantage on saving throws against
spells and other magical effects.

***Scent of Prey.*** The devil dog knows the exact location of any soul
whose true name it knows, as long as that soul resides in a vessel or body
within 1 mile. If the soul is beyond that distance, it knows the direction
the soul lies in. If the soul is on a different plane of existence, it knows the
plane that the soul resides on.

### Actions
