***Earth Glide.*** The ferrous worm can burrow through nonmagical,
unworked earth and stone. While doing so, the ferrous worm doesnâ€™t
disturb the material it moves through.

***Camouflage.*** The ferrous worm has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth)
checks made to hide in rocky terrain and treasure piles.

***Treasure Sense.*** The ferrous worm can pinpoint, by scent, the location
of precious metals and stones, such as coins and gems, within 60 feet of it.
