**Parry.** Othovir adds 2 to his AC against one melee attack that would hit him. To do so, Othovir must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.

### Roleplaying Information

Othovir is a gifted harness-maker who doesn't talk about his family or where he came from. He cares about his business, his clients, and his good name.

**Ideal:** Find what you do well, and do it to the best of your ability.

**Bond:** I won't allow my name to be tarnished.

**Flaw:** I get angry when others pry into my private life.
