***Land’s Stride.*** Moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs the
splinter drake no extra movement, and it can pass through nonmagical
plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The splinter drake makes one bite attack and two claw attacks.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 12
(2d8 + 3) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10
(2d6 + 3) slashing damage.

***Thorn Volley (Recharge 5–6).*** The splinter drake emits a spray of
thorns in a 40-foot cone. Creatures within this area must make a DC 16
Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) piercing damage and 28 (8d6)
poison damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a
successful saving throw.
