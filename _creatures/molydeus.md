***Innate Spellcasting.*** The molydeus's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma. It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:
* At will: dispel magic, polymorph, telekinesis, teleport
* 3/day: lightning bolt
* 1/day: imprisonment

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the molydeus fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** The molydeus has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Magic Weapons.*** The molydeus's weapon attacks are magical.

### Actions

***Multiattack*** The molydeus makes three attacks: one with its weapon, one with its wolf bite, and one with its snakebite.

***Demonic Weapon*** Melee Weapon Attack: +16 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 20 (2d10 + 9) slashing damage. If the target has at least one head and the molydeus rolled a 20 on the attack roll, the target is decapitated and dies if it can't survive without that head. A target is immune to this effect if it takes none of the damage, has legendary actions, or is Huge or larger. Such a creature takes an extra 6d8 slashing damage from the hit.

***Wolf Bite*** Melee Weapon Attack: +16 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d6 + 9) piercing damage.

***Snakebite*** Melee Weapon Attack: +16 to hit, reach 15 ft., one creature. Hit: 12 (1d6 + 9) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 22 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target transforms into a manes if this reduces its hit point maximum to 0. This transformation can be ended only by a wish spell.
