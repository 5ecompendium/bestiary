***Poor Vision.*** Tendril puppets see almost nothing beyond 30 feet away.

***Regeneration.*** The tendril puppet regains 5 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and is in jungle terrain.

***Root Mind.*** Within a vine lord's forest or jungle, the tendril puppet's blindsight extends to 60 feet, it succeeds on all Wisdom (Perception) checks, and it can't be surprised.

***Green Strider.*** The tendril puppet ignores movement restrictions and damage caused by natural undergrowth.

***Magic Resistance.*** The tendril puppet has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Actions

***Assegai.*** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage, or 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack.

***Hurl Thorns.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) piercing damage, and the thorn explodes in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on the target. Every creature in the affected area other than the original target takes 4 (1d8) piercing damage, or half damage with a successful DC 13 Dexterity saving throw.
