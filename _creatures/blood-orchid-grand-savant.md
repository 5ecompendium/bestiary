***Hyper-Awareness.*** The blood orchid cannot be surprised.

***Spellcasting.*** The blood orchid is a 7th level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 17, +9 to hit with spell attacks). It can cast the following spells:

* Cantrips (at will): <i>dancing lights, fire bolt, light, mage hand</i>

* 1st level (4 slots): <i>burning hands, color spray, detect magic, magic missile</i>

* 2nd level (3 slots): <i>darkness, ray of enfeeblement, scorching ray</i>

* 3rd level (3 slots): <i>lightning bolt, vampiric touch</i>

* 4th level (1 slots): <i>fire shield</i>

***Telepathic Bond.*** Blood orchids have a telepathic link to other blood orchids that are within 120 feet.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The blood orchid uses Blood Drain. It then makes up to three attacks with its tentacles.

***Tentacles.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (3d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage and the target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. The target is also grappled (escape DC 15). While grappled this way, the creature is restrained. Until the grapple ends, the blood orchid can’t use this tentacle on another target. The blood orchid has three tentacles that it can attack with.

***Blood Drain.*** The blood orchid feeds on the creature it is grappling. The creature must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by 5 (1d10). This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.
