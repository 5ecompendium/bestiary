***Hyper-Awareness.*** The blood orchid cannot be surprised.

***Spellcasting.*** The blood orchid is a 7th level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 17, +9 to hit with spell attacks). It can cast the following spells:

Cantrips (at will): dancing lights, fire bolt, light, mage hand

1st level (4 slots): burning hands, color spray, detect magic, magic missile

2nd level (3 slots): darkness, ray of enfeeblement, scorching ray

3rd level (3 slots): lightning bolt, vampiric touch

4th level (1 slots): fire shield

***Telepathic Bond.*** Blood orchids have a telepathic link to other blood orchids that are within 120 feet.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The blood orchid uses Blood Drain. It then makes up to three attacks with its tentacles.

***Tentacles.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (3d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage and the target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. The target is also grappled (escape DC 15). While grappled this way, the creature is restrained. Until the grapple ends, the blood orchid canâ€™t use this tentacle on another target. The blood orchid has three tentacles that it can attack with.

***Blood Drain.*** The blood orchid feeds on the creature it is grappling. The creature must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by 5 (1d10). This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.
