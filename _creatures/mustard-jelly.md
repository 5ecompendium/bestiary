***Amorphous.*** The jelly can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch
wide without squeezing.

***Energy Absorption.*** A mustard jelly is immune to force and lightning
damage. If the jelly would have taken force or lightning damage, it is
instead healed for the same amount it would have taken in damage.

***Magic Weapons.*** The jelly’s attacks are magical.

***Spider Climb.*** The jelly can climb difficult surfaces, including upside
down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

***Poison Aura.*** At the start of each of the jelly’s turns, each creature
within 10 feet of it takes 10 (3d6) poison damage. A creature that touches
the jelly or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 10
(3d6) poison damage.

### Actions

***Pseudopod.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit:
12 (3d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage and 10 (3d6) acid damage.
