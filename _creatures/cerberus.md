***Devil’s Sight.*** Magical darkness doesn’t impede Cerberus' darkvision.

***Keen Hearing and Smell.*** Cerberus has advantage on Wisdom
(Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.

***Legendary Resistance (3/day).*** If Cerberus fails a saving throw, it can
choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** Cerberus has advantage on saving throws against
spells and other magical effects.

***Multiple Heads.*** Cerberus has three heads. While it has more than one
head, Cerberus has advantage on saving throws against being blinded,
charmed, deafened, frightened, stunned, or knocked unconscious.
Whenever Cerberus takes 40 or more damage in a single turn, one of its
heads dies. If all its heads die, Cerberus dies.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** Cerberus makes three bite attacks and one claw attack.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 23
(3d10 + 7) piercing damage plus 14 (4d6) fire damage.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 10ft., one target. Hit: 20
(3d8 + 7) slashing damage.

***Fire Breath (Recharge 5–6).*** One of Cerberus’ heads releases a 60-foot
cone of flames. Each creature in the area must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving
throw, taking 42 (12d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage
on a successful saving throw. Each head has its own recharge counter.

### Legendary Actions

Cerberus can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options
below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only
at the end of another creature’s turn. Cerberus regains spent legendary
actions at the start of its turn.

***Open/Close the Gate.*** Cerberus causes the Gate of Hell to open if it is
closed, or close if it is open.

***Bite.*** Cerberus makes a Bite attack.

***Fire Breath (Costs 3 Actions).*** Cerberus uses its Fire Breath ability,
even if it has not recharged.
