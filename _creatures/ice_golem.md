***Icy Destruction.*** When the golem dies, it shatters in an explosion of
jagged ice shards, and each creature within 15 feet of it must make a DC
13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) piercing damage and 7 (2d6)
cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Immutable Form.*** The golem is immune to any spell or effect that
would alter its form.

***Magic Resistance.*** The golem has advantage on saving throws against
spells and other magical effects.

***Magic Weapons.*** The golem’s weapon attacks are magical.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The golem can make two slam attacks.

***Slam.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 10
(2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) cold damage.

***Cold Breath (Recharge 5–6).*** The golem exhales a blast of freezing
wind in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 13
Dexterity saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) cold damage on a failed save, or
half as much damage on a successful one.
