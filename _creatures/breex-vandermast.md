***Relentless Endurance (1/Long Rest).*** When Breex is reduced to 0 hit points, but not killed outright, he can drop to 1 hit point instead.

***Savage Attack.*** When Breex scores a critical hit with a melee weapon attack, he can roll one of the weapon's damage dice one additional time and add it to the extra damage of the critical hit.

***Spellcasting.*** Breex is a 5th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 13, +5 to hit with spell attacks). Breex knows the following sorcerer spells:

* Cantrips (at will): <i>chill touch, firebolt, message, minor image, shocking grasp</i>

* 1st level (4 slots): <i>expeditious retreat, feather fall, sleep</i>

* 2nd level (3 slots): <i>blur, misty step</i>

* 3rd level (2 slots): <i>haste</i>

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** Breex makes two melee attacks.

***Greatsword.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage.

### Reactions

***Parry.*** Breex adds 2 to his AC against one melee attack that would hit him. To do so, Breex must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
