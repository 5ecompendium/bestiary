***Echolocation.*** The mobat can’t use its blindsight while deafened.

***Flyby.*** The mobat doesn’t provoke an opportunity attack when it flies out
of an enemy’s reach.

***Keen Hearing.*** The mobat has advantage on Wisdom (Perception)
checks that rely on hearing.

### Actions

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13
(3d6 + 3) piercing damage.

***Stunning Screech (Recharge 5–6).*** The mobat emits a piercing
screech. All creatures within 30 feet of it that can hear it must make a DC

can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect
on itself on a success.
