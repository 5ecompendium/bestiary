***Eye-Closer's Curse.*** If a sandman obtains a critical hit or successful surprise attack against an opponent, its talons scratch a rune onto the target's eyeballs that snaps their eyelids shut, leaving them blinded. This effect can be ended with greater restoration, remove curse, or comparable magic.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The sandman's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 15). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

At will: darkness, minor illusion, plane shift (at night only), phantom steed, prestidigitation, sleep (11d8)

3/day each: hypnotic pattern, major image

1/day each: dream, phantasmal killer (5d10)

***Stuff of Dreams.*** Made partially from dreams and imagination, a sandman takes only half damage from critical hits and from sneak attacks. All of the attack's damage is halved, not just bonus damage.

***Surprise Attack.*** If the sandman hits a surprised creature during the first round of combat, the target takes 14 (4d6) extra damage from the attack.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The sandman makes two claw attacks.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage.
