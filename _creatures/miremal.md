***Amphibious.*** The miremal can breathe air and water.

***Swamp Camouflage.*** The miremal has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in swampy terrain.

***Savage Move.*** If the miremal surprises a creature, it gets a bonus action it can use on its first turn of combat for a claw attack, a bite attack, or a Bog Spew attack.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The miremal makes two attacks, one of which must be a claw attack.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage.

***Bog Spew (Recharge 5-6).*** The miremal spews a noxious stream of bog filth mixed with stomach acid at a target up to 20 feet away. Target must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1d4 rounds.

### Reactions

***Muddled Escape (1/Day).*** If an attack would reduce the miremal's hit points to 0, it collapses into a pool of filth-laden swamp water and its hit points are reduced to 1 instead. The miremal can move at its normal speed in this form, including moving through spaces occupied by other creatures. As a bonus action at the beginning of the miremal's next turn, it can reform, still with 1 hit point.
