***Agile Flight.*** The gnome may use his mechawings to hover in place and may make hairpin turns, granting him an AC bonus of +2 while flying.

***Gnome Cunning.*** The aerial assault gnome has advantage on all spells and magical effects that require an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw.

***Armored Flight Suit.*** The aerial assault gnome wears a futuristic suit of lightweight, yet extremely strong, mechanized armor that provides comfort and protection.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The aerial assault gnome can make two attacks: one with his cog thrower and one with Last Resort.

***Cog Thrower.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (3d6) slashing damage. A stream of razor-sharp cogs is propelled from the gnomeâ€™s hollow metallic club.

***Last Resort.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 5 ft., one target.
Hit: 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage. The gnome whips his enemy with the still hot metal barrels of his cog thrower.

***Strafing Run (3/day).*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, range 120/400 ft., one target. Hit: a point the gnome can see. A blast of fire emanates from the target point. Any creatures in a 20-foot radius of the target must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 28 (8d6) fire damage
on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Reactions

***Point Defense.*** Any creature moving within 20 feet of the aerial assault gnome is blasted by his point defense cannons for 7 (3d4) piercing damage.
