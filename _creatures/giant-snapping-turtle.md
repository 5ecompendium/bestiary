***Amphibious.*** The turtle can breathe air and water.

***Stable.*** Whenever an effect knocks the turtle prone, it can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to avoid being knocked prone. A prone turtle is upside down. To stand up, it must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity check on its turn and then use all its movement for that turn.

### Actions

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (4d6 +4) slashing damage.
