***Create Spawn.*** Any humanoid creature slain by the mohrg rises as a
zombie at the beginning of the mohrg’s next turn. If this occurs, the mohrg
regains 10 hit points, and the morhg can immediately make one slam
attack as a reaction.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The mohrg makes two slam attacks and one attack with
its tongue.

***Slam.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13
(2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled and restrained
(escape DC15), and the morhg can’t grapple another creature or use its
slam attack.

***Tongue.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit:
The target must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failed
save, the target takes 21 (6d6) necrotic damage and is paralyzed for 1
minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its
turns, ending the effect on a success.
