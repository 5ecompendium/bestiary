***Invisible in Water.*** The water weird is invisible while fully immersed in water.

***Water Bound.*** The water weird dies if it leaves the water to which it is bound or if that water is destroyed.

### Actions

***Constrict.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 13 (3d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it is grappled (escape DC 13) and pulled 5 ft. toward the water weird. Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, the water weird tries to drown it, and the water weird can't constrict another target.
