***Undead Fortitude.*** If damage reduces the zoblin to 0
hit points, it must make a Constitution saving
throw with a DC of 10 + the damage taken, unless
the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a
success, the zoblin drops to 1 hit point instead.

***Putrid.*** A creature that touches the zoblin or hits it
with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 1
necrotic damage.

### Actions

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +2 to hit, reach 5ft.,
one target. Hit: 2 (1d4) slashing damage.
