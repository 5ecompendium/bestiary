***False Appearance.*** While the bog creeper remains
motionless, it is indistinguishable from normal plants.

***Marsh Move.*** A bog creeper doesn’t treat marshy,
swampy terrain as difficult terrain.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The bog creeper makes up to four attacks:
one with its bite, one slam, and two with its tendrils.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit,
reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4)
piercing damage.

***Slam.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit,
reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d10 + 4)
bludgeoning damage.

***Tendrils.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit,
reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4)
bludgeoning damage. The target is grappled
(escape DC 14) if the bog creeper isn’t
already grappling a creature, and the target
is restrained until the grapple ends. The bog
creeper can only grapple one target.

***Acid Spray (3/day).*** The bog creeper sprays stomach acid in a 30-foot
cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving
throw, taking 14 (3d8) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much
damage on a successful one.
