***Born of Rime.*** A rime worm can breathe air or water with equal ease.

***Ringed by Ice and Death.*** A rime worm is surrounded by an aura of cold, necrotic magic. At the start of the rime worm's turn, enemies within 5 feet take 2 (1d4) cold damage plus 2 (1d4) necrotic damage. If two or more enemies take damage from the aura on a single turn, the rime worm's black ice spray recharges immediately.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The rime worm makes two tendril attacks.

***Tendril.*** Melee Weapon Attack. +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d6 + 5) slashing damage. If both tendril attacks hit the same target in a single turn, that target is grappled (escape DC 15). The rime worm can grapple one creature at a time, and it can't use its tendril or devour attacks against a different target while it has a creature grappled.

***Devour.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (2d12 + 5) slashing damage. If the target was grappled by the rime worm, it takes an additional 13 (2d12) cold damage.

***Black Ice Spray (Recharge 5-6).*** The rime worm sprays slivers of ice in a line 30 feet long and 5 feet wide. All creatures in the line take 26 (4d12) necrotic damage and are blinded; a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw prevents the blindness. A blinded creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effect on itself with a successful save.
