***Magic Resistance.*** The temple dog has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Protector's Initiative.*** If the temple dog is entering combat against a clear threat to its temple, it has advantage on its initiative roll.

***Rushing Slam.*** If the temple dog moves at least 10 feet straight toward a target and then makes a slam attack against that target, it can make an additional slam attack against a second creature within 5 feet of the first target as a bonus action.

### Actions

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (3d8 + 4) piercing damage plus 9 (2d4 + 4) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 14). The target must also make a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of its next turn.

***Slam.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (3d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone and pushed 5 feet. The temple dog can immediately enter the position the target was pushed out of, if it chooses to.
