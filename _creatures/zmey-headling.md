***Amphibious.*** The zmey headling can breathe air and water.

***Regeneration.*** The zmey headling reaver regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn. This trait doesn't function if the zmey headling took acid or fire damage since the end of its previous turn. It dies if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.
