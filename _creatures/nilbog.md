***Innate Spellcasting.*** The nilbog's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 12). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

At will: mage hand, Tasha's hideous laughter, vicious mockery 1/day: confusion

***Nilbogism.*** Any creature that attempts to damage the nilbog must first succeed on a DC 12 Charisma saving throw or be charmed until the end of the creature's next turn. A creature charmed in this way must use its action praising the nilbog. The nilbog can't regain hit points, including through magical healing, except through its Reversal of Fortune reaction.

***Nimble Escape.*** The nilbog can take the Disengage or Hide action as a bonus action on each of its turns.

### Actions

***Fool's Scepter.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6+2) bludgeoning damage.

***Shortbow.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6+2) piercing damage.

### Reactions

***Reversal of Fortune.*** In response to another creature dealing damage to the nilbog, the nilbog reduces the damage to 0 and regains 1d6 hit points.
