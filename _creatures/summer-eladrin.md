***Fearsome Presence.*** Any non-eladrin creature that starts its turn within 60 feet of the eladrin must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature becomes frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to any eladrin's Fearsome Presence for the next 24 hours.

***Fey Step (Recharge 4-6).*** As a bonus action, the eladrin can teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.

***Magic Resistance.*** The eladrin has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Actions

***Multiattack*** The eladrin makes two weapon attacks.

***Longsword*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage plus 4 (1d8) fire damage, or 15 (2d10 + 4) slashing damage plus 4 (1d8) fire damage if used with two hands.

***Longbow*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) piercing damage plus 4 (1d8) fire damage.

### Reactions

***Parry*** The eladrin adds 3 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the eladrin must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
