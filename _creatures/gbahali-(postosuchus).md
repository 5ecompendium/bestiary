***Chameleon Hide.*** The gbahali has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. If the gbahali moves one-half its speed or less, attacks made against it before the start of the gbahali's next turn have disadvantage.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The gbahali makes one bite attack and two claw attacks.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 24 (3d12 + 5) piercing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the gbahali can't bite another target.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) slashing damage.
