***Keen Smell.*** The kruthik has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.

***Pack Tactics.*** The kruthik has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the kruthik's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.

***Tunneler.*** The kruthik can burrow through solid rock at half its burrowing speed and leaves a 10-foot-diameter tunnel in its wake.
