***Trample.*** If the bison moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature
and then hits it with a gore attack on the same turn, that target must succeed
on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is
prone, the bison can make one stomp attack against it as a bonus action.

### Actions
