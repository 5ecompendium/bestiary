***Innate Spellcasting.*** The cambium's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 17, +9 to hit with spell attacks). The cambium can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

Constant: levitate

At will: alter self, detect thoughts, hold person, plane shift, spare the dying

3/day: cure wounds 21 (4d8 + 3), ray of sickness 18 (4d8), protection from poison, heal

1/day: finger of death

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The cambium makes four needle fingers attacks.

***Needle Fingers.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 21 (3d10 + 5) piercing damage. In addition, the target must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw; if it fails, the cambium can either inflict Ability Damage or Imbalance Humors. A target makes this saving throw just once per turn, even if struck by more than one needle fingers attack.

***Ability Damage (3/Day).*** When the target of the cambium's needle fingers fails its Constitution saving throw, one of its ability scores (cambium's choice) is reduced by 1d4 until it finishes a long rest. If this reduces a score to 0, the creature is unconscious until it regains at least one point.

***Imbalance Humors (3/Day).*** When the target of the cambium's needle fingers fails its Constitution saving throw, apply one of the following effects:

***Sanguine Flux: The target cannot be healed.*** aturally or magically.until after their next long rest.

***Choleric Flux: The target becomes confused (as the spell) for 3d6 rounds.*** The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns to shrug off the flux before the duration ends.

***Melancholic Flux: The target is incapacitated for 1d4 rounds and slowed (as the spell) for 3d6 rounds.*** The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns to shrug off the flux before the duration ends.

***Phlegmatic Flux: A successful DC 18 Constitution saving throw negates this effect.*** A failed saving throw means the target gains one level of exhaustion which lasts for 3d6 rounds.
