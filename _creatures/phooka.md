***One with Nature.*** When a phooka is slain through violence, all plants
within a 100-foot radius of where it fell die and no new ones grow
naturally in that area for 1 year.

***Tree Stride.*** Once on its turn, the phooka can use 10 feet of its
movement to step magically into one living tree within its reach and
emerge from a second living tree within 60 feet of the first tree, appearing
in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the second tree. Both trees must
be Large or bigger.

### Actions

***Dagger.*** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range
20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage.
