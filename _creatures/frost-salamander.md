***Burning Fury.*** When the salamander takes fire damage, its Freezing Breath automatically recharges.

### Actions

***Multiattack*** The salamander makes five attacks: four with its claws and one with its bite.

***Claws*** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d6 + 5) piercing damage.

***Bite*** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d8 + 5) piercing damage and 5 (1d10) cold damage.

***Freezing Breath (Recharge 6)*** The salamander exhales chill wind in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 44 (8d10) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
