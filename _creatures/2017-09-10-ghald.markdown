***Assassinate.*** During its first turn, Ghald has advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn. Any hit Ghald scores against a surprised creature is a critical hit.

***Limited Amphibiousness.*** Ghald can breathe air and water, but he needs to be submerged at least once every 4 hours to avoid suffocating.

***Shark Telepathy.*** Ghald can magically command any shark within 120 feet of him, using a limited telepathy.

***Sneak Attack.*** Ghald deals an extra 14 (4d6) damage when he hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of Ghald's that isn't incapacitated and Ghald doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

**Actions**

***Multiattack.*** Ghald makes three attacks, one with his bite and two with his shortswords.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 9 (2d4 + 4) piercing damage.

***Shortsword.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage.

***Garrote.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one Medium or Small creature against which Ghald has advantage on the attack roll. Hit: 9 (2d4 + 4) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 15). Until the grapple ends, the target can't breathe, and Ghald has advantage on attack rolls against it.
