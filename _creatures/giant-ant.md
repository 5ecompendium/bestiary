***Keen Smell.*** The giant ant has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The giant ant makes one bite attack and one sting attack.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d8 + 2) bludgeoning damage and the target is grappled (escape DC 12). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and the giant ant can't bite a different target.

***Sting.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage plus 22 (4d10) poison damage, or half as much poison damage with a successful DC 12 Constitution saving throw.
