***Innate Spellcasting.*** The dragon's innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence. It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

At will: tongues

3/day: enhance ability

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The dragon makes one bite attack and two claw attacks.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d10 + 3) slashing damage, and the target loses 3 hit point from bleeding at the start of each of its turns for six rounds unless it receives magical healing. Bleeding damage is cumulative; the target loses 3 hp per round for each bleeding wound it has taken from a mithral dragon's claws. 

***Breath Weapon (Recharge 5-6).*** A mithral dragon can spit a 50-foot-long, 5-foot-wide line of metallic shards. Targets in its path take 21 (6d6) magical slashing damage and lose another 5 hit points from bleeding at the start of their turns for 6 rounds; slashing damage is halved by a successful DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, but bleeding damage is not affected. Only magical healing stops the bleeding before 6 rounds. The shards dissolve into wisps of smoke 1 round after the breath weapon's use
