***Acid.*** A creature that touches the golem or hits it with a melee attack
while within 5 feet of it takes 9 (2d8) acid damage.

***Amorphous.*** The golem can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch
wide without squeezing.

***Death Throes.*** When the ooze golem drops to 0 hit points, its body
explodes in a 10-foot sphere. Creatures in that area must make a DC 15
Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) acid damage on a failed saving
throw, or half as much damage on a successful saving throw. The area of
the golem’s death throes remains acidic for 1 minute after death, and any
creature that begins its turn in the area or enters it is affected as well.

***Immutable Form.*** The golem is immune to any spell or effect that
would alter its form.

***Magic Resistance.*** The golem has advantage on saving throws against
spells and other magical effects.

***Magic Weapon.*** The golem’s weapon attacks are magical.

***Regeneration.*** The ooze golem regains 10 hit points at the beginning of
each of its turns as long as it has at least 1 hit point.

***Spider Climb.*** The golem can climb difficult surfaces, including upside
down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The ooze golem makes two slam attacks.

***Slam.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13
(2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 9 (2d8) acid damage.
