***Gliding Wings.*** The tosculi drone can use its wings to slowly descend when falling (as if under the effect of the feather fall spell). It can move up to 5 feet horizontally for every foot it falls. The tosculi drone can't gain height with these wings alone. If subjected to a strong wind or lift of any kind, it can use the updraft to glide farther.

***Skittering.*** Up to two tosculi can share the same space at one time. The tosculi has advantage on melee attack rolls while sharing its space with another tosculi that isn't incapacitated.

***Light Crossbow.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage.
