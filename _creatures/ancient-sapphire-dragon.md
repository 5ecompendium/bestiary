***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the dragon fails
a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

***Awe Aura.*** All creatures within 30 feet must

creature’s turn ends immediately. On a success,
that creature is immune to the Awe Aura of all
gemstone dragons for 1 week.

dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the
following effects. The dragon can’t use the same
effect two rounds in a row.

* The dragon manifests <i>flay</i> in a 120-foot cone,
doing 1d6 damage per charge spent.

* The dragon manifests <i>reflection</i> at no cost. It
cannot use this action again for a week.

* The dragon casts <i>plane shift</i> with DC 22.

### Regional Effects

Intelligent creatures who sleep within 12 miles of a
sapphire dragon’s lair dream of the past and future.
They know the things they see in these dreams are
real events that have, or will, occur.
