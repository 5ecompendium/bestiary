***Improved Critical.*** Greatsword attacks score a critical hit on a roll of
19 or 20.

***Magical Weapons.*** Attacks by the sword wight using its weapons are
considered to be magical.

***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** While in sunlight, the sword wight has
disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks
that rely on sight.

***Weapon Master.*** When using its greatsword attack, a sword wight
may reroll any 1 on damage dice, keeping the second result.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The sword wight makes two
greatsword attacks or two longbow attacks. It can use its life drain in
place of one greatsword attack.

***Greatsword.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
Hit: 8 (2d6 + 1) slashing damage.

***Life Drain.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.
Hit: 4 (1d6 + 1) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 15
Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an
amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target
finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point
maximum to 0.

A humanoid slain by this attack rises 24 hours later as a zombie under
the wight’s control, unless the humanoid is restored to life or its body is
destroyed. The wight can have no more than twelve zombies under its
control at one time.

***Longbow.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one
target. Hit: 5 (1d8 + 1) piercing damage.

### Reactions

***Parry.*** The sword wight adds 2 to its AC against one melee attack
that would hit it. To do so, the sword wight must see the attacker and be
wielding a melee weapon.
