***Pounce.*** If the likho moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a claw attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the likho can use a bonus action to make two additional claw attacks against it.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The likho's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 16). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

At will: message

3/day each: crown of madness, mirror image, ray of enfeeblement

1/day: bestow curse

***Magic Resistance.*** The likho has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The likho makes two claw attacks.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage.

***Disruptive Gaze.*** As a bonus action, the likho directs its gaze at any single creature it can see and afflicts it with a temporary bout of bad luck. The targeted creature has disadvantage on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks until the end of its next turn.
