***Camouflage.*** A coral drake's coloration and shape lend to its stealth, granting the creature advantage on all Stealth checks while it's underwater.

***Water Breathing.*** The coral drake can breathe only underwater.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The coral drake makes one bite attack, one claw attack, and one stinger attack.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d10 + 4) piercing damage.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 22 (4d8 +4) slashing damage.

***Stinger.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d10 + 4) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 7 (2d6) poison damage at the start of each of its turns for 4 rounds. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Breath Weapon (Recharge 5-6).*** Coral drakes nurture their offspring in specialized throat sacs. They can pressurize these sacs to spew forth a 15-foot cone of spawn. Each target in this area takes 21 (6d6) piercing damage from thousands of tiny bites and is blinded for 1d4 rounds; a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw reduces the damage by half and negates the blindness.
