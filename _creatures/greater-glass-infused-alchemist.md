explodes in a burst of sharp glass. Each creature
within 5 feet of it must make a make a DC 13
Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) slashing
damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on
a successful one.

***Reflective Skin.*** The alchemist has advantage on
saving throws against spells and other magical
effects.

***Vicious Cuts.*** If the alchemist hits the same target
with both slashing strikes on the same round of
combat, the target takes an additional 11 (2d10)
piercing damage as glass shards cut deeply into
flesh.

### Actions

damage.

***Rain of Glass (Recharge 5-6).*** The alchemist holds
out its hands and unleashes a blast of glass shards
in a 15 foot cone. Each creature in that area must
make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22
(4d10) slashing damage on a failed save, or have as
much damage on a successful one.
