***Shortsword Masters.*** Black skeletons gain defensive bonuses (+2 to
AC) and bonuses to attack (+2 to hit) when wielding two shortswords
(included in the statistics).

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The black skeleton makes two claw attacks or two
shortsword attacks.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8
(1d8 + 4) slashing damage, and the target’s Strength score is reduced
by 1d4. The target dies if this reduces its strength to 0. Otherwise, the
reduction lasts until the target finishes a short or long rest.

***Shortsword.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage, and the target’s Strength score is
reduced by 1d4. The target dies if this reduces its strength to 0. Otherwise,
the reduction lasts until the target finishes a short or long rest
