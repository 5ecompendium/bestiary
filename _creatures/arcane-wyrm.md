***Arcane Flicker.*** Instead of flying, the wyrm can
teleport between locations by expending that
much movement.

***Translucent Body.*** The wyrm has advantage on
Stealth checks.

### Actions

***Arcane Volley.*** The wyrm unleashes 2 jolts of arcane
energy at one or two targets within 120 feet. These
jolts automatically hit and deal 3 (1d4 + 1) force
damage.
