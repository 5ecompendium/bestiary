***Life Sense.*** The risen reaver automatically detects all living creatures within 120 feet. This sense is blocked by 3 feet of wood, 1 foot of earth or stone, an inch of metal, or a thin sheet of lead.

***Pounce.*** When the risen reaver hits an enemy with its blade attack after moving at least 20 feet, the target creature must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failure, the creature falls prone and the risen reaver can use a bonus action to make a single blade attack.

***Infused Arsenal.*** As a bonus action, the risen reaver can absorb one unattended weapon into its body. For every weapon it absorbs, it deals +1 damage with its blade attacks ( maximum of +3).

***Skitter.*** The risen reaver can take the Dash action as a bonus action.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The risen reaver makes three blade attacks.

***Blade.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 15 (2d10 + 4) slashing damage.
