***Charge.*** If the nuckalavee moves at least 20 feet straight toward a
creature and then hits it with a greataxe attack, that target must succeed
on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is
prone, the nuckalavee can make one attack with its hooves against it as a
bonus action.

***Horrific Appearance.*** Any creature that starts its turn within 20 feet
of the nuckalavee must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed
save, the creature is frightened until the start of its next turn. If a creature’s
saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to the nuckalavee’s
horrific appearance for the next 24 hours.

***Magic Resistance.*** The nuckalavee has advantage on saving throws
against spells and other magic effects.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The nuckalavee makes four attacks: two with its greataxe,
one bite attack, and one attack with its hooves.

***Greataxe.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit:
12 (2d6 + 5) slashing damage.

***Hooves.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14
(2d8 + 5) slashing damage.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10
(2d4 + 5) piercing damage.

***Poisonous Breath (Recharge 5–6).*** The nuckalavee exhales a cloud of
caustic gas in a 20-foot cone. Creatures in this area must make a DC 15
Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) acid damage on a failed save, or
half as much damage on a successful one.
