***Innate Spellcasting.*** The dryad's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 17). She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

* At will: <i>dancing lights, druidcraft</i>

* 3/day each: <i>charm person, entangle, invisibility, magic missile</i>

* 1/day each: <i>barkskin, counterspell, dispel magic, fog cloud, shillelagh, suggestion, wall of thorns</i>

***Magic Resistance.*** The dryad has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Speak with Beasts and Plants.*** The dryad can communicate with beasts and plants as if they shared a language.

***Tree Stride.*** Once on her turn, the dryad can use 10 feet of her movement to step magically into one dead tree within her reach and emerge from a second dead tree within 60 feet of the first tree, appearing in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the second tree. Both trees must be Large or bigger.

***Tree Dependent.*** The dryad is mystically bonded to her duskthorn vines and must remain within 300 yards of them or become poisoned. If she remains out of range of her vines for 24 hours, she suffers 1d6 Constitution damage, and another 1d6 points of Constitution damage every day that follows - eventually, this separation kills the dryad. A dryad can bond with new vines by performing a 24-hour ritual.
