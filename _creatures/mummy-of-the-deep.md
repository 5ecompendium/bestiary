***Amphibious.*** Mummies of the deep can breathe air and water.

***Innate Spellcasting (1/day).*** The mummy can innately cast <i>control
water</i>, requiring no material components. Its innate spellcasting ability
is Wisdom

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The mummy can use its Dreadful Glare and makes one
attack with its necrotizing strike.

***Necrotizing Strike.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5ft., one
target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic
damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution
saving throw or be cursed with necrotic fever. The cursed target can’t
regain hit points, and its hit point maximum decreases by 10 (3d6) for
every 24 hours that elapse. If the curse reduces the target’s hit point
maximum to 0, the target dies, and its body turns to pluff mud. The curse
lasts until removed by the remove curse spell or other magic.

***Dreadful Glare.*** The mummy targets one creature it can see within 60
feet of it. If the target can see the mummy, it must succeed on a DC 12
Wisdom saving throw against this magic or become frightened until the
end of the mummy’s next turn. If the target fails the saving throw by 5 or
more, it is also paralyzed for the same duration. A target that succeeds on
the saving throw is immune to the Dreadful Glare for all mummies (but no
mummy lords) for the next 24 hours.

***Drowning Breath.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target. Hit: The creature is grappled (escape DC 13). If the creature has
not broken the mummy’s grapple by the start of the mummy’s next turn,
the mummy uses its next action to press its lips against the creature’s and
regurgitates seawater into the creature’s lungs. The creature immediately
begins suffocating (see the fifth edition SRD for more information on
suffocation). While suffocating, the creature can only use its actions to
try and cough the seawater up, requiring a successful DC 12 Constitution
saving throw to do so.
