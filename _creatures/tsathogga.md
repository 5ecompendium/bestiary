***Acidic Hide.*** A creature that touches Tsathogga or hits it with a melee
attack while within 10 feet of it takes 35 (10d6) acid damage. Any
nonmagical weapon made of metal or wood that hits Tsathogga instantly
dissolves before dealing damage.

***Amphibious.*** Tsathogga can breathe both water and air.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** Tsathogga’s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma
(spell save DC 24, +16 to hit with spell attacks).

command, detect magic, fog cloud, grease, inflict wounds </i>(5th level)

***Legendary Resistance (3/day).*** If Tsathogga fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** Tsathogga has advantage on saving throws against
spells and other magical effects.

***Magic Weapons.*** Tsathogga’s weapon attacks are magical.

***Unholy Aura.*** An unholy aura surrounds Tsathogga out to a radius of 40
feet. A creature who enters or begins their turn in the area must make a DC
20 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the target is frightened
for 1 minute. While frightened, they are paralyzed. A frightened target can
repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect
on a success.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** Tsathogga uses its Blasphemous Croak ability, then uses
its tongue attack. If there is a creature within range, it can then use its bite
attack and two claw attacks.

***Bite.*** Up to three targets of Huge size or smaller within 10 feet of
Tsathogga must make a DC 27 Dexterity saving throw. On a successful
saving throw, it takes 44 (10d6 + 9) piercing damage, plus 35 (10d6)
acid damage, and is grappled. On a failed saving throw, the target is
swallowed. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has
total cover against attacks and other effects outside of Tsathogga, and it
takes 56 (16d6) acid damage at the start of each of Tsathogga’s turns. If
Tsathogga takes 50 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside
it, Tsathogga must succeed on a DC 25 Constitution saving throw at the
end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in
a space with 10 feet of Tsathogga. If Tsathogga dies, a swallowed creature
is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using all of its
movement, exiting prone.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +19 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 40
(9d6 + 9) slashing damage plus 35 (10d6) acid damage.

***Tongue.*** Tsathogga chooses one creature that it can see within 40 feet
of it. That target must make a DC 28 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed
saving throw, the target takes 37 (8d6 + 9) bludgeoning damage plus 35
(10d6) acid damage and is grappled. Tsathogga can use a bonus action to
pull a creature grappled by it up to 40 feet towards it.

***Blasphemous Croak.*** Tsathogga utters a blasphemous croak audible to
all creatures within 300 feet of it. Those that can hear it must make a DC
24 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the target takes 28
(8d6) necrotic damage and 28 (8d6) thunder damage and is stunned for 1
minute. On a successful saving throw, the target takes half damage and is
not stunned. A stunned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of
each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

***Summon (1/day).*** Tsathogga summons 2d6 hezrous, 2d4 greruors, 1
nalfeshnee, or 1 balor. The summoned demon appears in an unoccupied
space within 60 feet of Tsathogga, and can’t summon other demons. It
remains for 1 minute, until it or Tsathogga is slain, or until Tsathogga
takes an action to dismiss it.

### Legendary Actions

Tsathogga can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options
below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only
at the end of another creature’s turn. Tsathogga regains spent legendary
actions at the start of its turn.

***Retract Tongue.*** Tsathogga can pull one creature grappled by its
tongue attack 40 feet towards it.

***Quake.*** Tsathogga causes the area around it to violently shake in a
radius of 100 feet. Creatures in the area must make a DC 24 Dexterity
saving throw or fall prone. Until the beginning of Tsathogga’s next turn,
the ground continues shaking, and creatures must repeat the saving throw
to rise from prone.

***Seeping Darkness (Costs 2 Actions).*** Magical darkness fills the area
surrounding Tsathogga out to a distance of 50 feet. The darkness spreads
around corners, douses any nonmagical lights, and any light-producing
spell of 6th level or lower is immediately dispelled. The magical darkness
remains for 1 hour, or until Tsathogga uses an action to dismiss it.

### Lair Actions

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Tsathogga takes a lair
action to cause one of the following magical effects.

***Acid Swamp.*** Tsathogga chooses an area of swamp that it can see within
120 feet of it. The area can be no larger than a 30-foot cube. Creatures in
the area must make a DC 24 Strength saving throw. On a failed saving
throw, the target takes 21 (6d6) acid damage and is grappled (escape DC
24). On a successful saving throw, the target takes half damage and is not
grappled. On the next initiative count 20, the target takes an additional 21
(6d6) acid damage if it is still grappled by this lair action.

***Insect Swarms.*** Tsathogga causes 7 (2d6) insect swarms to converge
on an area of Tsathogga’s choosing that it can see.

***Swamp Mist.*** Tsathogga causes swamp mist to rise. This acts as if
Tsathogga had cast the fog cloud spell as a 9th level spell. Tsathogga does
not need to maintain concentration on this effect.
