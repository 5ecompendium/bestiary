***Innate Spellcasting.*** The steel predator's innate spellcasting ability is Wisdom. The steel predator can innately cast the following spells, requiring no components:

* 3/day each: <i>dimension door </i>(self only)<i>, plane shift </i>(self only)

***Magic Resistance.*** The steel predator has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Magic Weapons.*** The steel predator's weapon attacks are magical.

### Actions

***Multiattack*** The steel predator makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claw.

***Bite*** Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d6 + 7) piercing damage.

***Claw*** Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d8 + 7) slashing damage.

***Stunning Roar (Recharge 5-6)*** The steel predator emits a roar in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 27 (5d10) thunder damage, drops everything it's holding, and is stunned for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage. The stunned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
