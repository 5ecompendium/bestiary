### Legendary Actions

The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing

option can be used at a time and only at the end of
another creature’s turn. The dragon regains spent
legendary actions at the start of its turn.

***Detect.*** The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) Check.

damage and be knocked prone. The dragon then
can move up to half its movement speed.

### Lair Actions

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the
dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the
following effects. The dragon can’t use the same
effect two rounds in a row.

* The dragon manifests <i>believe</i> at no cost.

* The dragon manifests <i>forget</i> at no cost. If it
forces the target to forget a spell, the dragon
knows that spell and can cast it using Intelligence
as its spellcasting ability, with a DC
of 23.

* The dragon manifests an illusion of a shifting
battlefield. The terrain within 30 feet of it is
considered difficult terrain until the end of the
dragon’s next turn.

### Regional Effects

Intelligent creatures who sleep within 12 miles of an
amethyst dragon’s lair dream of an opulent party
with a charming host to whom they willingly and
happily reveal their deepest secrets.
