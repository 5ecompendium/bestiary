***Hyper-Awareness.*** A blood orchid cannot be surprised.

***Telepathic Bond.*** Blood orchids have a telepathic link to other
blood orchids that are within 120 feet.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The blood orchid uses Blood Drain. It then makes
up to three attacks with its tentacles.

***Tentacles.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target. Hit: 10 (2d8 + 1) bludgeoning damage and the target must
succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for
1 hour. The target is also grappled (escape DC 11). While
grappled this way, the creature is restrained. Until the
grapple ends, the blood orchid canâ€™t use this tentacle on
another target. The blood orchid has three tentacles that it
can attack with.

***Blood Drain.*** The blood orchid feeds on the creature it is grappling.
The creature must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or its
hit point maximum is reduced by 5 (1d10). This reduction lasts until the
creature finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit
point maximum to 0.
