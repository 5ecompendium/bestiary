### Actions

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage.

***Shortspear.*** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage.

***Fire Breath (Recharge 6).*** The behtu exhales fire in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area takes 21 (5d8) fire damage, or half damage with a successful DC 13 Dexterity saving throw.

***Ichorous Infusions.*** Behtu war parties carry 1d6 vials of ichorous infusions. They often ingest an infusion before an ambush. For the next 2d6 rounds, the behtus gain a +4 bonus to their Strength and Constitution scores and quadruple their base speed (including their climb speed). Behtus also take a -4 penalty to their Intelligence and Wisdom scores for the duration of the infusion. A non-behtu character who ingests a behtu infusion becomes poisoned and takes 10 (3d6) poison damage; a successful DC 14 Constitution saving throw against poison reduces damage to half and negates the poisoned condition.
