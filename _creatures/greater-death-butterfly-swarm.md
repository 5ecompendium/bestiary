***Potent Poison.*** The death butterfly swarm's poison affects corporeal undead who are otherwise immune to poison.

***Swarm.*** The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny insect. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit point.

***Weight of Wings.*** As death butterfly swarm but with DC 16 Dexterity saving throw

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The swarm makes a Bite attack against every target in its spaces.

***Bites.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 0 ft., every target in the swarm's space. Hit: 24 (6d6 +3) piercing damage, or 13 (3d6 + 3) piercing damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer. The target also takes 17 (5d6) poison damage and becomes poisoned for 1d4 rounds; a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw reduces poison damage by half and prevents the poisoned condition.
