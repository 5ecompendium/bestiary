***Pounce.*** If the zombie moves at least 20 feet
straight toward a creature and then hits it with a
claw attack on the same turn, that target must
succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be
knocked prone. If the target is prone, the zombie
can make one bite attack against it as a bonus
action.

***Undead Fortitude.*** If damage reduces the zombie
to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving
throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless
the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a
success, the zombie drops to 1 hit point instead.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The zombie makes two attacks: one
with its bite and one with its claws.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft.,
one target. Hit: 8 (1d10 + 3) piercing damage.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft.,
one target. Hit: 8 (1d10 + 3) slashing damage, and if
the target is a creature it must succeed on a DC 12
Constitution saving throw or contract Sewer Plague
(see "Diseases" in chapter 8 of the Dungeon
Masterâ€™s Guide).
