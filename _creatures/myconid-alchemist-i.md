***Stalk-still.*** A myconid that remains perfectly still has advantage on
Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide.

### Actions

***Stone Knuckles.*** Melee weapon attack: +5 to hit. Hit: 6 (1d6+3)
slashing damage.

***Spore Bomb.*** Ranged weapon attack: +3 to hit, range 30/60 ft. Hit: 2
(1d4) poison damage and the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution
saving throw or see 4 versions of the myconid for 1 minute. An affected
creature making an attack against one of the visions has a 25% chance to
hit the real myconid. The affected creature can attempt the saving throw
at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.
