***Magic Resistance.*** The lesser erinyes has advantage on saving throws against spells and other
magical effects.

***Poisoned Weapons.*** The lesser erinyesâ€™s weapon
attacks are magical and deal an extra 4 (1d8)
poison damage on a hit (included in its attacks).

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The lesser erinyes makes
three attacks.

***Longsword.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit,
reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing
damage, or 8 (1d10 + 3) slashing damage if used
with two hands, plus 4 (1d8) poison damage.

***Longbow.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit,
range 150/600 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d8 + 2)
piercing damage plus 4 (1d8) poison damage,
and the target must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned. The poison
lasts until it is removed by the lesser restoration
spell or similar magic.

### Reactions

***Parry.*** The lesser erinyes can add 4 to its AC
against one melee attack that would hit it. To do
so, the lesser erinyes must see the attacker and
be wielding a melee weapon.
