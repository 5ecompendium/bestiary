***Fire Friend.*** A brown mold does not take damage from fire. Instead,
it heals that amount. If the available healing is greater than the brown
mold’s maximum number of hit points, its maximum hit points increases
by that amount.

***Cold Sensitive.*** Magical cold damage instantly and automatically kills
a brown mold.

### Actions

***Spore Burst.*** The brown mold releases spores that burst out in a
cloud that fills a 15-foot cube centered on it, and the cloud lingers for 1
minute. Any creature that ends its turn in the cloud must make a DC 13
Constitution saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) necrotic damage on a failed
save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Additionally, the
target’s hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage
taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target
dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.
