***Undead Nature.*** A vampiric mist doesn't require air or sleep.

***Blood Sense.*** The vampiric mist can sense living creatures that have blood or similar vital fluids in a radius of 60 feet .

***Forbiddance.*** The vampiric mist can 't enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants.

***Misty Form.*** The vampiric mist can occupy another creature's space and vice versa. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can pass through it without squeezing. Each foot of movement in water costs it 2 extra feet, rather than l extra foot. The mist can 't manipulate objects in any way that requires hands; it can apply simple force only.

***Sunlight Hypersensitivity.*** The vampiric mist takes 20 radiant damage when it starts its turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, the mist has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.

**Actions**

***Blood Drain.*** One creature in the vampiric mist's space must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw (undead and constructs automatically succeed). On a failed save, the target takes 10 (2d6 + 3) necrotic damage, its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the mist regains hit points equal to that amount.

>This reduction to the target's hit point maximum lasts until the target finishes a long rest. It dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.
