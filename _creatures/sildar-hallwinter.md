### Actions

***Multiattack.*** Sildar makes two melee attacks.

***Longsword.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d8 + 1) slashing damage.

***Heavy Crossbow.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +2 to hit, range 100 ft./400 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d10) piercing damage.

### Reactions

***Parry.*** When an attacker hits Sildar with a melee attack and Sildar can see the attacker, he can roll 1d6 and add the number rolled to his AC against the triggering attack, provided that he's wielding a melee weapon.
