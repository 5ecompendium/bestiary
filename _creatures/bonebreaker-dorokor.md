***Aggressive.*** As a bonus action, the orc can
move up to its speed toward a hostile creature it
can see.

***Wielder of Wound.*** Bonebreaker Dorokor wields
the magical greataxe <i>Wound.</i>


### Actions

***Multiattack.*** Bonebreaker Dorokor makes three
weapon attacks, or she makes two attacks and
issues a War Cry if it is available.

***Wound.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5
ft., one target. Hit: 11(1d12 + 5) slashing damage
plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage. The target’s
maximum hit points are decreased in equal
amount to the necrotic damage dealt. The target’s
hit point maximum does not return to normal until
it finishes a long rest or its grievous wounds are
soothed by a greater restoration spell.

***Longbow.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range
150/600 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage.

***War Cry (Recharge 4–6).*** Dorokor screams an
orcish war phrase, spurring her warriors on toward
victory. Choose one of the following effects:
* ***Rally:*** All of Dorokor’s minions within 30 feet
that can hear her gain 22 (4d10) temporary
hit points.
* ***Focus:*** All of Dorokor’s minions within 30 feet
that can hear her will have advantage on the
next attack roll they make before the end of
their next turn.
* ***Charge:*** All of Dorokor’s minions within 30 feet
that can hear her can move up to their speed as
a reaction.

### Reactions

***Villain Ability: Warlord.*** As a reaction, when
a minion dies, Dorokor can issue a command to her other
minions. Those who can hear her gain a reaction
they can use to immediately take another movement.
