***Fire Form.*** The elemental can move through a space
as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing. A
creature that touches the elemental or hits it with a
melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 1 fire
damage.

***Illumination.*** The elemental sheds bright light in a
10-foot radius and dim light in an additional 10
feet.

***Water Susceptibility.*** For every 5 feet the elemental
moves in water, or for every gallon of water
splashed on it, it takes 1 cold damage.

### Actions

***Touch.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft.,
one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) fire damage. If the
target is a creature or a flammable object, it ignites.
Until a creature takes an action to douse the fire,
the target takes 2 (1d4) fire damage at the start of
each of its turns.

***Blaze.*** Ranged Spell Attack: +3 to hit, range 30 ft.,
one target. Hit: 5 (1d10) fire damage.
