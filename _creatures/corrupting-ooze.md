***Corrupting Touch.*** When a corrupting ooze scores a critical hit or starts its turn with a foe grappled, it can dissolve one leather, metal, or wood item of its choosing in the possession of the target creature. A mundane item is destroyed automatically; a magical item is destroyed if its owner fails to make a successful DC 16 Dexterity saving throw.

***Strong Swimmer.*** A corrupting ooze naturally floats on the surface of water. It swims with a pulsating motion that propels it faster than walking speed.

### Actions

***Slam.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 3 (1d6) acid damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 13).
