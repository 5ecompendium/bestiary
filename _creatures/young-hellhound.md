***Keen Hearing and Smell.*** The hound has advantage
on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on
hearing or smell.

***Pack Tactics.*** The hound has advantage on an attack
roll against a creature if at least one of the hound’s
allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally
isn’t incapacitated.

***Pounce.*** If the hound moves at least 10 feet straight
toward a target and then hits it with a bite attack on
the same turn, the target takes an extra 2 (1d4)
piercing damage and must succeed on a DC 11
Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

### Actions

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5ft.,
one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage plus 3
