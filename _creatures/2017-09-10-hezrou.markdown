***Magic Resistance.*** The hezrou has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Stench.*** Any creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the hezrou must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to the hezrou's stench for 24 hours.

**Actions**

***Multiattack.*** The hezrou makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d10 + 4) piercing damage.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage.

***Variant: Summon Demon (1/Day).*** The demon chooses what to summon and attempts a magical summoning.

A hezrou has a 30 percent chance of summoning 2d6 dretches or one hezrou.

A summoned demon appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of its summoner, acts as an ally of its summoner, and can't summon other demons. It remains for 1 minute, until it or its summoner dies, or until its summoner dismisses it as an action.
