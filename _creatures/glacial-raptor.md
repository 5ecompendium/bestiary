***Frozen Ferocity.*** When the raptor hits with a melee
attack, it deals an extra 2 (1d4) cold damage
(included in the attack).

***Pack Tactics.*** The raptor has advantage on an attack
roll against a creature if at least one of the raptor’s
allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally
isn’t incapacitated.

### Actions

***Multiattack.** The raptor makes one attack with its
bite and one with its claws.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5ft.,
one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage plus 2
(1d4) cold damage.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5ft.,
one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage plus 2
(1d4) cold damage.

***Frozen Gaze (Recharge 6).*** The raptor locks eyes
with a creature and attempts to freeze it from the
inside out. The target must make a DC 12
Constitution saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) cold
damage and gaining one level of exhaustion on a
failed save, or half as much damage and not
exhausted on a successful one.
