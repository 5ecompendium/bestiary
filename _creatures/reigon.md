***Chameleon.*** Whenever the reigon takes the hide action, it has advantage
on Dexterity (Stealth) checks as it uses psionic illusions to assist its
attempt. Creatures with truesight automatically notice the reigon while it
attempts to hide.

***Keen Smell.*** The reigon has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks
that rely on smell.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The reigon makes one bite attack, and two greatclub
attacks or two claw attacks.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 13
(2d8 + 4) piercing damage.

13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.

***Mindthrust (1/day).*** One creature the reigon can see within 60 feet of it
must make a DC 13 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed saving throw,
the target takes 25 (4d10 + 3) psychic damage, or half as much damage on
a successful saving throw.

***Concussion Blast (1/day).*** The reigon releases a blast of psionic force
in a 15-foot cone. Creatures in the area must make a DC 13 Constitution
saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the target takes 21 (4d8 + 3) force
damage and is stunned until the end of their next turn. On a successful
saving throw, the target takes half damage and is not stunned.
