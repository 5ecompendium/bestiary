***Surprise Attack.*** If the cavern lizard surprises a creature and hits it with
an attack during the first round of combat, the target takes an extra 14
(4d6) damage from the attack.

### Actions

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 22
(3d10 + 6) piercing damage and the target is grappled (escape DC 16), and
the gnasher lizard can only grapple one creature at a time.

***Thrash.*** The gnasher lizard rapidly shakes its head, and any grappled
target takes 39 (6d10 + 6) slashing damage. If this damage is enough to
drop the target to 0 hit points, the target is dismembered and portions of it
are swallowed. A creature who suffers this cannot be brought back to life
with anything less than true resurrection.
