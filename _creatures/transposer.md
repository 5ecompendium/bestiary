***Innate Spellcasting.*** The transposer’s
innate spellcasting ability is Charisma
(spell save DC 11, +3 to hit with spell
attacks). It can innately cast <i>alter self</i> at
will requiring no material components.

***Transposition.*** An opponent hit by a transposer’s slam attack must make
a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become linked to the transposer.
A transposer can have no more than 4 linked creatures at a time. While
linked, the transposer knows the exact location of the target as long as
it is on the same plane of existence.

While the transposer remains linked to a target, any damage the
transposer takes is halved, and each linked target takes an equal
amount. If a transposer’s linked target regain hit points, the
amount received by the target is halved, and the transposer
regains an equal amount of hit points.

A <i>remove curse</i> or <i>dispel magic</i> cast on the linked target can
end the link. If <i>dispel magic</i> is cast on the transposer, one random link
is severed. Otherwise the link lasts until the targert dies or the transposer
chooses to end the link.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The transposer makes two attacks with its slam.

***Slam.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9
(2d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage.
