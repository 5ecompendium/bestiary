***Amphibious.*** The mahoru can breathe air and water.

***Keen Sight and Smell.*** The mahoru has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight or smell.

***Pack Tactics.*** The mahoru has advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one of the mahoru's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.

***Blood Frenzy.*** The mahoru has advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature that isn't at maximum hit points.

### Actions

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 20 (3d10 + 4) slashing damage.

***Roar.*** When a mahoru roars all creatures with hearing within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened until the end of the mahoru's next turn. If the target fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it's also paralyzed for the same duration. A target that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to the Roar of all mahoru for the next 24 hours.

***Vorpal Bite.*** A mahoru's saw-like jaws are excel at dismembering prey. When the mahoru scores a critical hit, the target must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or lose an appendage. Roll a d12 and consult the following table for the result:
* 1-2: right hand
* 3-4: left hand
* 5-6: right food
