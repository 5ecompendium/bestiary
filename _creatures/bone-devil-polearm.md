***Devil's Sight.*** Magical darkness doesn't impede the devil's darkvision.

***Magic Resistance.*** The devil has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The devil makes three attacks: two with its hooked polearm and one with its sting.

***Hooked Polearm.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (2d12 + 4) piercing damage. If the target is a huge or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 14). Until the grapple ends, the devil can't use its polearm on another target.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) slashing damage.

***Sting.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage plus 17 (5d6) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success .
