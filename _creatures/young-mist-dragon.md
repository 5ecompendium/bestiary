***Amphibious.*** The mist dragon can breathe both water and air.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The dragon uses its Frightful Presence and makes three
attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 17
(2d10 + 6) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) fire damage.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13
(2d6 + 6) slashing damage.

***Breath Weapon (Recharge 5–6).*** The mist dragon uses one of the
following breath weapons.

1. <i>Obscuring Mist.</i> The dragon exhales a murky opaque
mist in a 30-foot cube that spreads around corners. This mist
heavily obscures the area and remains for 1 minute, or until
dispersed with a moderate or stronger wind (at least 10 miles
per hour).

2. <i>Scalding Mist.</i> The dragon exhales a fiery blast of
lingering mist in a 30-foot cone that spreads around
corners. The mist lightly obscures the area and remains for 1
minute, or until dispersed with a moderate or stronger wind (at
least 10 miles per hour). Each creature that enters the area or
begins their turn there must make a DC 17 Constitution saving
throw, taking 49 (14d6) fire damage on a failed saving throw, or
half as much damage on a successful one. Being underwater doesn’t
grant resistance to this damage.

***Mist Form.*** The mist dragon polymorphs into a Large cloud of mist,
or back into its true form. While in mist form, the dragon can’t take any
actions, speak, or manipulate objects. It is weightless, has a flying speed
of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature’s space and stop
there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so
without squeezing, and it can’t pass through water. It has advantage on
Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, it is immune to all
nonmagical damage.
