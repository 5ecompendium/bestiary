***Deal of a Lifetime.*** If killed, the body of the black bulette shatters
into shards of obsidian glass, freeing the devil imprisoned within. The
devil may be of any random type (GM’s discretion) save that of a royal
rank. The devil will be grateful to whoever is responsible for ending its
centuries-long confinement, and will offer the responsible parties one
favor in payment before returning to the infernal realms of its home plane.
Wise recipients of this offer should bear in mind that the usual caveats of
treating with devils remain in full force when striking any bargains.

***Detect Evil and Good.*** The bulette knows if there is an aberration,
celestial, elemental, fey, fiend, or undead within 30 feet of it and where
the creature is located. The bulette also knows if there is a place or object
within 30 feet of it that has been consecrated or desecrated.

***Dual Planar Connection.*** The black bulette has a planar tie to the
Abyss, where it appears as a chained adamantine cask shaped like an
abstracted bulette.

***Infernal Stench.*** Any creature that starts its turn within 120 feet of
the bulette must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be
poisoned until the start of its next turn. Coming into physical contact with
a black bulette results in the creature being imparted with a horrid stench
that causes it to have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks for 12
hours. The stench can be removed sooner with plenty of soap, water, and
two full hours of scrubbing.

***Magic Resistance.*** The bulette has advantage on saving throws against
spells and other magical effects.

### Actions

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 58
(8d12 + 6) piercing damage.

***Abyssal Breath (Recharge 5–6).*** The bulette exhales fire in a 60-foot
cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving
throw, taking 42 (12d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much
damage on a successful one.
