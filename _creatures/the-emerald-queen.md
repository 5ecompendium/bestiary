***Legendary Resistance (1/Day).*** If the queen fails a saving
throw, she can choose to succeed instead.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The queen makes two attacks: one with her
shortsword and one with her thornwhip, or two attacks
with her longbow.

***Shortsword.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5ft.,
one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) slashing damage plus 7
(2d6) fire damage.

***Thorn Whip.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach
15ft., one target. Hit: 9 (2d4 + 4) slashing damage. The
target is grappled (escape DC 14) if the Queen is not
already grappling a creature. Until the grapple ends, the
target takes 10 (3d6) piercing damage at the start of
each of its turns. If the queen uses this attack while a
target is already grappled, she may pull the target to her
and deal an additional 9 (2d4 +4) piercing damage
automatically.

***Longbow.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, range
150/600 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing
damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage.

***Hail of Thorns (Recharge 5-6).*** The queen launches a
volley of deadly thorns in a 30-foot cone. Each creature
in the area must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw,
taking 35 (10d6) piercing damage on a failed save, or
half as much damage on a successful one.

### Legendary Actions

The queen can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from
the options below. Only one legendary action can be
used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s
turn. The queen regains spent legendary actions at the
start of her turn.

***Strike.*** The queen makes an attack with her shortsword
or her longbow.

***Swift Repositioning.*** The queen can move up to half of
her movement speed without provoking attacks of
opportunity.

### Lair Actions

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the queen takes a
lair action to cause one of the following effects; the queen
can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row.

* Vines erupt from the floor and attempt to envelop a
creature the queen can see within 120 feet of her. The
target must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or
become restrained. A creature can use its action to make a
DC 14 Strength saving throw, ending the effect on a
success. The vines wilt away when the queen uses this lair
action again or when she dies.

* A burst of thorns explodes from the wall and launch at two
creatures with deadly precision. Those creatures must
succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 17
(5d6) piercing damage.

* A magical green energy billows around one creature the
queen can see within 120 feet of her. The creature must
make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or or be charmed by
the queen until she chooses another lair action.
