***Innate Spellcasting.*** The hag's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 15, +7 to hit with spell attacks). She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

At will: disguise self, inflict wounds (4d10), message, ray of enfeeblement

1/day each: detect thoughts, dispel magic, lightning bolt, locate creature, shillelagh, stinking cloud, teleport

***Magic Resistance.*** The hag has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Confounding Ugliness.*** When confronting a mirror hag at any range, a creature must make a choice at the start of each of its turns: either avert its eyes so that it has disadvantage on attack rolls against the hag until the start of its next turn, or look at the hag and make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. Failure on the saving throw leaves the character stunned until the start of its next turn.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** A mirror hag can use its Reconfiguring Curse and make one melee attack.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 21 (4d8 + 3) piercing damage, or 39 (8d8 + 3) piercing damage against a stunned target.

***Quarterstaff.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage.

***Reconfiguring Curse.*** The mirror hag curses a living creature within 60 feet, giving it beastly or hideous features. The target of the reconfiguring curse must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 Charisma damage. A successful save renders the target immune to further uses of that hag's curse for 24 hours.
