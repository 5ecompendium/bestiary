***Alien Mentality.*** A liosalfar's exotic consciousness renders it immune to psychic effects, and any attempt to read their thoughts leaves the reader confused for 1 round.

***Darkness Vulnerability.*** Magical darkness is harmful to a liosalfar: They take 2d10 necrotic damage, or half damage with a successful DC 14 Constitution saving throw, each time they start their turn inside magical darkness. Natural darkness is unpleasant to them but not harmful.

***Incorporeal Movement.*** The liosalfar can move through other creatures and objects as difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The liosalfar's innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 15, +7 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

At Will: augury, color spray, dancing lights, detect magic, flare, light, silent image, spare the dying

2/day each: alter self, blur, divination, hypnotic pattern, prismatic spray, scorching ray

1/day each: hallucinatory terrain, plane shift, sunbeam

***Lightform.*** Liosalfar are composed entirely of light. They are incorporeal and not subject to ability damage, polymorph, petrification, or attacks that alter their form.

***Prismatic Glow.*** Liosalfar shed rainbow illumination equal to a daylight spell. They cannot extinguish this glow without perishing but can reduce it to the level of torchlight at will. Even when using alter self they have a faint, diffused glow that's visible in dim light or darkness.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The liosalfar makes two Disrupting Touch attacks.

***Disrupting Touch.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 26 (4d12) radiant damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become stunned for 1 round.
