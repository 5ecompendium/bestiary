***Six Limb Charge.*** If the stone delver moves at least 20 feet straight
towards a target and then hits it with a claw attack on the same turn, the
target takes an extra 10 (3d6) slashing damage. If the target is a creature,
it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

If the stone delver hit its initial target on the same turn and knocked it
prone, it can use a bonus action to make up to four claw attacks against
targets that are adjacent to the initial target.

***Tunneler.*** The stone delver can burrow through solid stone at half its
burrowing speed leaving a 5 foot wide, 10-foot-high tunnel in its wake.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The stone delver makes three claw attacks.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 10
(1d10+5) slashing damage.
