***Immutable Form.*** The golem is immune to any spell or effect that
would alter its form.

***Magic Resistance.*** The golem has advantage on saving throws against
spells and other magical effects.

***Magic Weapon.*** The golem’s weapon attacks are magical.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The tallow golem makes two slam attacks.

***Slam.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit:
13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage. If the
tallow golem rolls a natural 20, the target also suffers from discolored
skin across its body and has disadvantage on Charisma skill checks. This
further effect can be restored with magic such as lesser restoration.
