***Aura of Hopelessness.*** The fallen empyreal can activate
or deactivate this feature as a bonus action. While active, all
creatures within 30 feet of it suffer 10 (3d6) necrotic damage at
the beginning of each of the fallen empyreal’s turns. The first time
a creature enters or starts its turn in the area it must succeed on a DC
16 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The target can
repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect
on itself on a success.

***Demonic Weapons.*** The empyreal’s weapon attacks are magical. When
the empyreal hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 4d8 necrotic
damage (included in the attack).

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The empyreal’s spellcasting ability is Charisma
(spell save DC 17, +9 to hit with spell attacks). The empyreal can innately
cast the following spells, requiring only verbal components:

At will: detect evil and good, darkness, dispel magic, fear, invisibility,
plane shift

5/day each: bestow curse, inflict wounds

3/day each: blade barrier, flame strike, scorching ray

1/day each: circle of death, create undead

***Magic Resistance.*** The empyreal has advantage on saving throws
against spells and other magical effects.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The fallen empyreal makes three attacks with its flaming
longsword.

***Flaming Longsword.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one
target. Hit: 15 (2d8 + 6) slashing damage plus 18 (4d8) necrotic damage.

***Necrotic Blast (Recharge 5–6).*** A fallen empyreal can unleash a blast
of necrotic energy in a 30-foot radius centered on itself. All creatures
in the area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 28 (8d6)
necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.
