***Rune Weapons.*** Kept keen with runic magic, runespears and runestaves are two-handed weapons that count as magical, though they provide no bonus to attack. Their magic must be renewed each week by a doom croaker or by Odin's own hand.

***Mimicry.*** Ravenfolk warriors can mimic the voices of others with uncanny accuracy. They have advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks involving audible mimicry.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** A ravenfolk warrior makes two runespear attacks, or two longbow attacks, or one ghost wings attack and one runespear attack. It can substitute one peck attack for any other attack.

***Ghost Wings.*** The ravenfolk warrior furiously "beats" a set of phantasmal wings. Every creature within 5 feet of the ravenfolk must make a successful DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be blinded until the start of the ravenfolk's next turn.

***Longbow.*** Ranged Weapon Attack. +5 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage.

***Peck.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage.

***Radiant Runespear.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d12 + 1) piercing damage plus 2 (1d4) radiant damage.

***Rapier.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage.

### Reactions

***Odin's Call.*** A ravenfolk warrior can disengage after an attack reduces it to 10 hp or less.
