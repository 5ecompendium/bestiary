***Pack Tactics.*** The beggar ghoul has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the beggar ghoul's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.

***Savage Hunger.*** A beggar ghoul that hits with its bite attack against a creature that hasn't acted yet in this combat scores a critical hit.

### Actions

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (2d6 + 2) piercing damage.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (2d4 + 2) slashing damage. If the target is a creature other than an elf or undead, it must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. A paralyzed target repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
