***Death Burst.*** When the Stonemelder dies, it turns to stone and explodes in a burst of rock shards, becoming a smoking pile of rubble. Each creature within 10 feet of the exploding Stonemelder must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 11 (2d10) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Spellcasting.*** The Stonemelder is a 7th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 13, +5 to hit with spell attacks). It knows the following sorcerer spells:

* Cantrips (at will): acid splash, blade ward, light, mending, mold earth

* 1st level (4 slots): expeditious retreat, false life, shield

* 2nd level (3 slots): Maximilian's earthen grasp, shatter

* 3rd level (3 slots): erupting earth, meld into stone

* 4th level (1 slot): stoneskin

### Actions
