***Death Burst.*** When the Stonemelder dies, it turns to stone and explodes in a burst of rock shards, becoming a smoking pile of rubble. Each creature within 10 feet of the exploding Stonemelder must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 11 (2d10) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Spellcasting.*** The Stonemelder is a 7th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 13, +5 to hit with spell attacks). It knows the following sorcerer spells:

* Cantrips (at will): <i>acid splash, blade ward, light, mending, mold earth</i>

* 1st level (4 slots): <i>expeditious retreat, false life, shield</i>

* 2nd level (3 slots): <i>Maximilian's earthen grasp, shatter</i>

* 3rd level (3 slots): <i>erupting earth, meld into stone</i>

* 4th level (1 slot): <i>stoneskin</i>

### Actions

***Black Earth Rod.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage. The Stonemelder can also expend a spell slot to deal extra damage, dealing 2d8 bludgeoning damage for a 1st level slot, plus an additional 1d8 for each level of the slot above 1st.
