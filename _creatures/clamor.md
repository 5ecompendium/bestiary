***Incorporeal Movement.*** The clamor can move through other creatures
and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage
if it ends its turn inside an object.

***Mimicry.*** The clamor can mimic any sound it has ever heard, including
humanoid voices. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are
imitations with a successful DC 17 Wisdom (Insight) check.

***Natural Invisibility.*** The clamor is invisible.

***Silence Vulnerability.*** If the clamor starts its turn in an area under
the effect of silence, it takes 13 (3d8) force damage, and it must make a
DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. While
frightened, it must use its action to Dash away from the area of silence. If
it begins its turn further than 60 feet away from the area of silence, it can
repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect
on a success.

### Actions

***Thunder Touch.*** Melee Spell Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) thunder damage, and the target is pushed 5 feet directly
away from the clamor.
