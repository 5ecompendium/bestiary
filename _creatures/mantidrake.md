***Flyby.*** The mantidrake doesn’t provoke an opportunity attack when it
flies out of an enemy’s reach.

***Keen Smell.*** The mantidrake has advantage on Wisdom (Perception)
checks that rely on smell.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The mantidrake makes three attacks: one with its bite and
two with its claws.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15
(2d8 + 6) piercing damage.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15
(2d8 + 6) slashing damage.

***Dragon Breath (Recharge 5–6).*** The mantidrake exhales its breath
based on its dragon head color. Each creature in the area affected
must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) damage on a
failed save, of half as much on a successful one.
