***Swift Repositioning.*** The fan dancer can disengage as a
bonus action.

***Dancing Leap.*** The fan dancer uses wind from its fans
to aid it in jumping. Its long jump is up to 20
feet and its high jump is up to 15 feet, with or
without a running start.

***Sneak Attack (1/turn).*** Whenever the dancer hits with an attack, it can deal an extra 17 (5d6) damage to one creature if it had advantage on the attack roll or if it has an ally within 5 feet of its target that isn’t incapacitated.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The dancer makes two attacks with its
bladed fans or with its wind strike.

***Bladed Fan.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach
5ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) slashing damage.

***Wind Strike.*** Ranged Weapon Attack +7 to hit, range
20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (2d4 + 4) slashing damage.

***Dance of a Ninety-Nine Slashes (Recharge 5-6).*** The
dancer performs an elaborate display with its fans,
throwing violent winds at all creatures within a 15-
foot radius sphere centered on the dancer.
Creatures in this area must make a DC 14 Dexterity
saving throw, taking 25 (10d4) slashing damage on
a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one. Creatures who failed this saving
throw are also pushed to the edge of the dance’s
radius.
