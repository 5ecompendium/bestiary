***Aggressive.*** As a bonus action, the orc can
move up to its speed toward a hostile creature it
can see.

***Minion: Savage Horde.*** After moving at least 20
feet in a straight line toward a creature, the next
attack the orc makes against that creature scores
a critical hit on a roll of 18â€“20.


### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The White Tusk juggernaut makes
one tusk attack and one longsword attack.

***Tusk.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft.,
one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage. If
the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC
14 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

***Longsword.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit,
reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage.

### Reactions

***Horde Protector.*** When a creature within 5 feet
of the orc is attacked by a creature the orc can
see and the orc is wielding a shield, the orc can
impose disadvantage on that attack roll.
