***Boscage Brachiation.*** The arboreal grappler doesn't provoke opportunity attacks when it moves out of an enemy's reach by climbing.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The arboreal grappler makes one bite attack and two tentacle attacks.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage.

***Tentacle.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 13). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and the tentacle can't be used to attack a different target. The arboreal grappler has two tentacles, each of which can grapple one target.
