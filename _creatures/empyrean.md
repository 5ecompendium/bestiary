At will: greater restoration, pass without trace, water breathing, water walk

1/day each: commune, dispel evil and good, earthquake, fire storm, plane shift (self only)

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the empyrean fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Weapons.*** The empyrean's weapon attacks are magical.

### Actions

***Maul.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +17 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 31 (6d6 + 10) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of the empyrean's next turn.

***Attack.*** The empyrean makes one attack.

***Bolster.*** The empyrean bolsters all nonhostile creatures within 120 feet of it until the end of its next turn. Bolstered creatures can't be charmed or frightened, and they gain advantage on ability checks and saving throws until the end of the empyrean's next turn.

***Trembling Strike (Costs 2 Actions).*** The empyrean strikes the ground with its maul, triggering an earth tremor. All other creatures on the ground within 60 feet of the empyrean must succeed on a DC 25 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
