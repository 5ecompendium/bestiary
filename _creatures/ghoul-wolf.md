***Keen Hearing and Smell.*** The ghoul wolf has advantage on Wisdom
(Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.

***Pack Tactics.*** The ghoul wolf has advantage on attack rolls against a
creature if at least one of the ghoul wolf’s allies is within 5 feet of the
creature and the ally isn’t incapacitated.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The ghoul wolf makes two attacks: one with its bite and
one with its claws.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 10
(2d6 + 3) piercing damage.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit:
8 (2d4 + 3) slashing damage. If the target is a creature other than an elf
or undead, it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be
paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end
of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
