***Magic Resistance.*** The netherspark has advantage on saving
throws against spells and other magic effects.

***Necrotic Aura.*** Being composed of necrotic energy, a netherspark
radiates an aura of such energy in a 10-foot radius. Any creature
that’s not an undead that enters or starts its turn within this area takes
7 (2d6) necrotic damage. Undead in the area instead regain 7 (2d6)
hit points, up to their maximum hit points at the beginning of each
of their turns.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The netherspark makes three slam
attacks.

***Slam.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft.,
one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) necrotic damage.

***Necrotic Ray.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit,
range 40 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d8+3) necrotic
damage. Undead take no damage but heal a number of
hit points equal to what the ray would otherwise deal.

***Necrotic Burst (Recharge 5–6).*** A netherspark can
release a burst of necrotic energy in a 20-foot radius
around it. Creatures in the area must make a DC 13
Constitution saving throw, taking 12 (2d8+3) necrotic
damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on
a successful one. Undead take no damage but heal a
number of hit points equal to what the burst would
otherwise deal.
