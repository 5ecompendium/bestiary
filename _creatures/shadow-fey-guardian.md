***Fey Ancestry.*** The shadow fey guardian has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put it to sleep

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The shadow fey's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma. It can cast the following spells innately, requiring no material components.

1/day: misty step (when in shadows, dim light, or darkness only)

***Shadow's Vigil.*** The shadow fey has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks, and magical darkness does not inhibit its darkvision.

***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** While in sunlight, the shadow fey has disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

***Traveler in Darkness.*** The shadow fey has advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks made to know about shadow roads and shadow magic spells or items.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The shadow fey makes two pike attacks.

***Pike.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d10 + 4) piercing damage.

***Javelin.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage.

### Reactions

***Protect.*** The shadow fey guardian imposes disadvantage on an attack roll against an ally within 5 feet. The guardian must be wielding a melee weapon to use this reaction.
