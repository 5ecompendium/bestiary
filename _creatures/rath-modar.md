***Special Equipment.*** Rath has a staff of fire, and scrolls of dimension door, feather fall, and fireball.

***Spellcasting.*** Rath is an 11th-level spellcaster who uses Intelligence as his spellcasting ability (spell save DC 15, +7 to hit with spell attacks). Rath has the following spells prepared from the wizard spell list:

* Cantrips (at will): fire bolt, minor illusion, prestidigitation, shocking grasp

* 1st level (4 slots): chromatic orb, color spray, mage armor, magic missile

* 2nd level (3 slots): detect thoughts, mirror image, phantasmal force

* 3rd level (3 slots): counterspell, fireball, major image

* 4th level (3 slots): confusion, greater invisibility

* 5th level (2 slots): mislead, seeming

* 6th level (1 slot): globe of invulnerability

### Actions

***Quarterstaff.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d8) bludgeoning damage.

### Reactions

***Illusory Self (Recharges on a Short or Long Rest).*** When a creature Rath can see makes an attack roll against him, he can interpose an illusory duplicate between the attacker and him. The attack automatically misses Rath, then the illusion dissipates.
