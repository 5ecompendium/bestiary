***Legendary Resistance (3/day).*** If the fly dragon fails a saving throw, it
can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** The fly dragon has advantage on saving throws
against spells and other magical effects.

***Spellcasting.*** The fly dragon is a 20th level spellcaster. Its spellcasting
ability is Charisma (spell save DC 18, +10 to hit with spell attacks). The
fly dragon’s spells require no material components, and individual fly
dragons know different sets of spells. A typical list is provided below:

* Cantrips (at will): <i>fire bolt, mage hand, message, minor illusion, prestidigitation, shocking grasp</i>

* 1st level (4/day): <i>detect magic</i>

* 2nd level (3/day): <i>darkness, suggestion</i>

* 3rd level (3/day): <i>haste</i>

* 4th level (3/day): <i>confusion, greater invisibility, wall of fire</i>

* 5th level (3/day): <i>hold monster, telekinesis</i>

* 6th level (2/day): <i>chain lightning, globe of invulnerability</i>

* 7th level (2/day): <i>plane shift, teleport</i>

* 8th level (1/day): <i>dominate monster</i>

* 9th level (1/day): <i>time stop</i>

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The dragon uses its Frightful Presence and makes three
attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +16 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12
(1d4 + 10) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) fire damage.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +16 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13
(1d6 + 10) slashing damage.

***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of the dragon’s choice that is within
60 feet of the fly dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 19 Wisdom
saving throw or become Frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat
the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself
on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends
for it, the creature is immune to the fly dragon’s Frightful Presence for the
next 24 hours.

***Fire Breath (Recharge 5–6).*** The dragon exhales fire in a 40-foot cone.
Creatures in the area must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw, taking
63 (18d6) fire damage, or half as much damage on a successful one. Being
underwater doesn’t grant resistance to this damage.

### Legendary Actions

The fly dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options
below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at
the end of another creature’s turn. The fly dragon regains spent legendary
actions at the start of its turn.

***Move.*** The fly dragon moves up to its speed without provoking
opportunity attacks.

***Cantrip.*** The fly dragon casts a cantrip.

***Detect.*** The fly dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.

***Cast a Spell (Costs 3 Actions).*** The fly dragon casts a spell from its list
of prepared spells, using a spell slot as normal.

### Lair Actions

At an initiative of 20, losing to ties, a fly dragon defending its lair can
take a lair action to cause one of the following effects. The fly dragon can’t
use the same effect two rounds in a row.

***Searing Wind.*** Super-heated air erupts from one or more passages the
fly dragon can see, filling one or more entire chambers of no more than
a 20-foot radius total with a searing wind. Each creature in the area must
make a DC 16 Constitution save, taking 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed
save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Unstable Footing.*** A tremor shakes the lair in a 40-foot radius around
the fly dragon. Each creature other than the fly dragon in contact with the
ground, walls, or ceilings in that area must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity
saving throw or be knocked prone.

***Noxious Fumes.*** Volcanic gases form a cloud in a 20-foot radius sphere
centered on a point the fly dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The sphere
spreads around corners, and its area is lightly obscured. It lasts until the
initiative count 20 on the next round. Each creature that starts its turn
in the cloud must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be
poisoned until the end of its turn. While poisoned in this way, a creature
is incapacitated.
