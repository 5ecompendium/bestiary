***Amphibious.*** A deep one can breathe air or water with equal ease.

***Frenzied Rage.*** On its next turn after a deep one archimandrite takes 10 or more damage from a single attack, it has advantage on its attacks, it adds +4 to damage, and it can make one extra unholy trident attack.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The deep one archimandrite's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 15, +7 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

At will: bless, revivify, sacred flame, shocking grasp, suggestion

3/day each: charm person, lightning bolt, sanctuary, shatter

1/day each: chain lightning, cone of cold, ice storm

***Legendary Resistance (1/Day).*** If the deep one archimandrite fails a saving throw, it can count it as a success instead.

***Lightless Depths.*** A deep one hybrid priest is immune to the pressure effects of the deep ocean.

***Voice of the Archimandrite.*** With a ringing shout, the deep one archimandrite summons all deep ones within a mile to come to his aid. This is not a spell but a command that ocean creatures and deep ones heed willingly.

### Actions

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack. +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) slashing damage.
