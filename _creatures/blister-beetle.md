### Actions

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 3 (1d6)
piercing damage plus 3 (1d6) acid damage.

***Blister Spray (Recharge 5–6).*** The beetle exhales a 15-foot cone of
caustic acid, causing painful blisters to form on the skin of any creature
caught in the spray. Creatures in the area must make a DC 12 Dexterity
saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) acid damage on a failed save, or half as
much damage on a successful one.
