***Shapechanger.*** The wereraven can use its action to polymorph into a raven-humanoid hybrid or into a raven, or back into its human form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its human form if it dies.

***Mimicry.*** The wereraven can mimic simple sounds it has heard, such as a person whispering, a baby crying, or an animal chittering. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Insight) check.
