***Find Target.*** The iron cobra knows the location
of a specific target creature as long as that creature
is within 1 mile of it. If the creature is moving, it
knows the direction if that creature’s movement.
If the target is beyond this distance, the iron cobra
can’t locate the target creature.

***Immutable Form.*** The iron cobra is immune to any
spell or effect that would alter its form.

***Magic Resistance.*** The iron cobra has advantage on
saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Magic Weapon.*** The iron cobra’s weapon attacks
are magical.

***Poison.*** The iron cobra contains enough venom
for three attacks. After that, it does not deal the poison
damage listed in its bite attack.
