***The Law of Death.*** At the start of each of
Death’s turns, undead within 10 feet of it take 10
force damage.

***Chaos Vulnerability.*** The Inexorables have disadvantage
on all saving throws against spells.

***Inexorable.*** The Inexorables are immune to any
effects that would slow them or deny them
actions or movement.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** Death’s innate spellcasting
ability is Charisma (spell save DC 13). It can
innately cast the following spells, requiring no
material components:

* 3/day: <i>death ward</i>

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** Death makes three slam attacks
or makes one slam attack and one Death to
Undeath attack.

***Slam.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft.,
one target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage.

***Death to Undeath.*** Death points at an undead
creature within 60 feet. The target must make
a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or take 33 (6d10)
force damage. On a successful save, the target
takes half that damage.
