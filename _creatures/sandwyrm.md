***Spine Trap.*** When underground with its spines exposed, the sandwyrm can snap its spines closed on one Large, two Medium, or four Small or Tiny creatures above it. Each creature must make a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be restrained. A restrained creature can use its action to make a DC 15 Strength check to free itself or another restrained creature, ending the effect on a success. Creatures restrained by this trait move with the sandwyrm. The sandwyrm's stinger attack has advantage against creatures restrained by this trait.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The sandwyrm makes one bite attack and one stinger attack. It can gore in place of the bite attack.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) piercing damage.

***Gore.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (1d12 + 5) piercing damage.

***Stinger.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) piercing damage plus 24 (7d6) poison damage, or half as much poison damage with a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw. If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target is stable but poisoned and paralyzed for 1 hour. Regaining hit points doesn't end the poisoning or paralysis.
