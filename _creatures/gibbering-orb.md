***Hyper-Awareness.*** A lesser gibbering orb can see in all directions at
once and cannot be surprised.

***Flyby.*** The lesser gibbering orb doesn’t provoke an opportunity attack
when it flies out of an enemy’s reach.

***Gibbering.*** The gibbering orb babbles incoherently while it can see any
creature and isn’t incapacitated. Each creature that starts its turn within
20 feet of the orb that can hear the gibbering must succeed on a DC 16
Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature can’t take reactions until
the start of its next turn and rolls a d8 to determine what it does during
its turn. On a 1 to 4, the creature does nothing. On a 5 or 6, the creature
takes no action or bonus action and uses all its movement to move in a
randomly determined direction. On a 7 or 8, the creature makes a melee
attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach or does
nothing if it can’t make such an attack.

***Magic Resistance.*** The gibbering orb has advantage on saving throws
against spells and other magical effects.

***Esoteric Theft.*** When a creature dies by being swallowed whole (or
when a creature killed by the lesser gibbering orb in some other fashion is
eaten by it), the lesser gibbering orb absorbs the creature’s known spells,
prepared spells, and innate magic abilities. The orb can use one of the
absorbed abilities per turn as a bonus action. Each originates from an eye
that is not producing an eye ray that round. Stolen spells and innate magic
abilities are lost after 24 hours.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The gibbering orb makes six bite attacks.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +19 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit:
37 (6d8 + 10) piercing damage. The target is grappled (escape DC 25)
if the gibbering orb isn’t already grappling a creature, and the target is
restrained until the grapple ends.

***Swallow.*** The gibbering orb makes one bite attack against a Large or
smaller target it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is swallowed,
and the grapple ends. The swallowed target is blinded and restrained, it
has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the gibbering orb,
and it takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the gibbering orb’s
turns. The gibbering orb can have only one target swallowed at a time.

If the gibbering orb dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained
by it and can escape from the corpse using 5 feet of movement, exiting
prone.

***Eye Rays.*** The orb casts three of the following spells as eye rays at
random (reroll duplicates), choosing one to three targets it can see within
150 ft. of it. The spells have a save DC 22 and +14 to hit.  Roll a d20 to determine the effects:

1. <i>acid arrow</i>
2. <i>blindness/deafness</i>
3. <i>chill touch</i>
4. <i>prismatic spray</i>
5. <i>forcecage</i>
6. <i>dispel magic</i>
7. <i>irresistible dance</i>
8. <i>feblemind</i>
9. <i>hypnotic pattern</i>
10. <i>inflict wounds</i>
11. <i>bestow curse</i>
12. <i>magic missile</i>
13. <i>ray of enfeeblement</i>
14. <i>ray of frost</i>
15. <i>finger of death</i>
16. <i>disintegrate</i>
