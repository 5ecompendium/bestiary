***Pack Tactics.*** The bandit lord has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the bandit lord's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The bandit lord makes three melee or ranged attacks.

***Greatsword.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft, one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage.

***Dagger.*** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage.

***Leadership (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** For 1 minute, the bandit lord can utter a special command or warning whenever a nonhostile creature that it can see within 30 feet of it makes an attack roll or a saving throw. The creature can add a d4 to its roll provided it can hear and understand the bandit lord. A creature can benefit from only one Leadership die at a time. This effect ends if the bandit lord is incapacitated.

### Reactions

***Parry.*** The bandit lord adds 2 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so the bandit lord must see the attacker and be wielding a weapon.

***Redirect Attack.*** When a creature the bandit lord can see targets it with an attack, the bandit lord chooses an ally within 5 feet of it. The bandit lord and the ally swap places, and the chosen ally becomes the target instead.
