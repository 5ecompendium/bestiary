***Pack Tactics.*** The mouse dragon has advantage on an attack roll against
a creature if at least one of the dragon’s allies is within 5 feet of the creature
and the ally isn’t incapacitated.

***Treasure Sense.*** The mouse dragon can pinpoint, by scent, the location
of precious metals and stones, such as coins and gems, within 60 feet of it.

***Underfoot.*** The mouse dragon can attempt to hide even when it is
obscured only by a creature that is at least one size larger than it.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The electrum mouse dragon makes one bite attack and two
claw attacks.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6
(1d8 + 2) slashing damage.

***Lightning Breath (Recharge 5–6).*** The dragon exhales lightning in a
20-foot line that is 1 foot wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC
