***Keen Smell.*** The raggoth has advantage on Wisdom
(Perception) checks that rely on smell.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The raggoth makes three attacks: one with its bite and two
with its claws.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15
(2d8 + 6) piercing damage.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 20
(4d6 + 6) slashing damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 17) and
restrained.

***Tormenting Howl (Recharge 5–6).*** The raggoth unleashes a piercing
howl. All creatures within 60 feet of the raggoth that can hear it must
succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute.
A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns,
ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is
successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the raggoth’s
Tormenting Howl for 24 hours.
