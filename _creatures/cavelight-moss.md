***Luminescence.*** The chemicals within cavelight moss make the entire creature shed light as a torch. A cavelight moss cannot suppress this effect. It can, however, diminish the light produced to shed illumination as a candle.

***Strength Drain.*** Living creatures hit by the cavelight moss's tendril attack or caught up in its grapple must make a successful DC 14 Constitution saving throw or suffer 1 level of exhaustion. Creatures that succeed are immune to that particular cavelight moss's Strength Drain ability for 24 hours. For every level of exhaustion drained, the cavelight moss gains 5 temporary hit points.

### Actions

***Tendrils.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 33 (4d12 + 7) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it is grappled (escape DC 17). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the cavelight moss can't use its tendrils against another target.
