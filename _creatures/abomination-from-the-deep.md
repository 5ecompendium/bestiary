***Amphibious.*** The abomination can breathe air and water.

***Natural Camouflage.*** The abomination has advantage
on stealth checks in aquatic environments.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The abomination makes three attacks:
two with its claws and one with its bite.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5ft.,
one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) slashing damage.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5ft.,
one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage, and
the target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution
saving throw against being paralyzed. On a failed
save, the creatureâ€™s body begins to go numb and is
restrained. It must repeat the saving throw at the
end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends.
On a failure, the creature is paralyzed for 1 hour.

***Putrid Water Spray (Recharge 5-6).*** The abomination
unleashes a spray of foul water in a 30-foot line.
Each creature in that area must make a DC 14
Dexterity saving throw, taking 16 (3d10) necrotic
damage and 16 (3d10) poison damage on a failed
save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
The abomination can track any creature affected by
this ability up to 5 miles away for the next 24
hours.
