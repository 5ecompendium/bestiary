***Flyby.*** The ala doesn't provoke an opportunity attack when it flies out of an enemy's reach.

***Poison Flesh.*** The ala's poison infuses its flesh. A creature that makes a successful bite attack against an ala must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw; if it fails, the creature takes 10 (3d6) poison damage.

***Storm's Strength.*** If an electrical storm is raging around an ala and its target, the saving throw against Lightning's Kiss is made with disadvantage.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The ala makes two claw attacks or one claw and one bite attack.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (1d10 + 5) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 16 saving throw or take 10 (3d6) poison damage.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) slashing damage.

***Lightning's Kiss (Recharge 5-6).*** One target within 50 feet must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. It takes 28 (8d6) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
