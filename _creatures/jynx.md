***Innate Spellcasting.*** The jynxâ€™s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma
(spell save DC 13, +5 to hit with spell attacks). The jynx can cast the
following spells without requiring material components:

* At will: <i>detect evil and good, detect magic</i>

* 1/day each: <i>color spray, detect thoughts, dispel magic, entangle</i>

### Actions

***Shortbow.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one
target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage.

***Shortsword.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage.

***Jinx (1/Short or Long Rest).*** The jynx chooses one target that it can
see within 60 feet of it to make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a
failed saving throw, the creature is jinxed for 1 minute. While jinxed,
the creature has disadvantage on all attack rolls, saving throws, and skill
checks until the jinx ends. The jinx can be ended early with remove curse.
