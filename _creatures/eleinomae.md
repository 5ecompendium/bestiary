***Unearthly Grace.*** The eleinomae's Charisma modifier is added to its armor class (included above).

***Reed Walk.*** The eleinomae can move across undergrowth or rivers without making an ability check. Additionally, difficult terrain of this kind doesn't cost it extra moment.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The eleinomae's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 15). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

At will: dancing lights

3/day each: charm person, suggestion

2/day each: hallucinatory terrain, major image

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The eleinomae makes three dagger attacks and one reed flower net attack.

***Dagger.*** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d4 + 4) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) poison damage.

***Reed Flower Net.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, range 5/15 ft., one Large or smaller creature. Hit: The target has disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws for 1 minute, and is restrained. A creature can free itself or another creature within reach from restraint by using an action to make a successful DC 15 Strength check or by doing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10).
