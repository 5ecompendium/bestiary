***Poison Trail.*** The savageclawâ€™s body exudes poison
in a 5 foot cube around it. Whenever the
savageclaw moves, this poison follows along and
fills every space the savageclaw touched during its
movement. This poison dissipates after 1 round.
Any creature that moves through one of these
poison clouds must succeed on a DC 12
Constitution saving throw or take 9 (2d8) poison
damage. A creature that holds their breath while
moving through one of these spaces has advantage
on the saving throw.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The savageclaw makes two attacks with
its bite.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5ft.,
one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage.

***Poison Tail.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach
5ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage
plus 7 (2d6) poison damage and the target must
succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or
become poisoned for 1 minute. Creatures poisoned
in this way cannot use reactions. A creature can
repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its
turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Noxious Discharge (1/Day).*** The savageclaw lets out
a powerful blast of poison gas in a 15 foot cube
originating on itself. Any creature in this area must
make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking 13
(3d8) poison damage on a failed save, or half as
much damage on a successful one.
