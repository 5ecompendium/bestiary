***Devil’s Sight.*** Magical darkness doesn’t impede the
devil’s darkvision.

***Impossible Speed.*** The devil cannot have its speed
reduced by any effect and can move triple its speed
when it takes the dash action.

***Magic Resistance.*** The devil has advantage on saving
throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Numbing Strikes.*** Whenever the devil makes a melee
attack against a creature, it doesn’t provoke attacks
of opportunity from that creature for the rest of the
turn, whether it hits or not.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The devil uses its Whirlwind ability. It
then makes three attacks with its unarmed strike.

***Unarmed Strike.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit,
reach 5ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d4 + 6) bludgeoning
damage.

***Whirlwind.*** The devil performs a quick spin that
generates a whirlwind in a 10 ft. radius sphere
centered on itself. All other creatures within this
whirlwind must succeed on a DC 13 Strength
saving throw or take 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage
and be flung up to 20 feet away from the whirlwind
in a random direction and knocked prone. If a
thrown target strikes an object, such as a·wall or
floor, the target takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage
for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is
thrown at another creature, that creature must
succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take
the same damage and be knocked prone.
