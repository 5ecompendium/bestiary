***Nictitating Membranes.*** Salt drakes have advantage on saving throws
against being blinded.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The salt drake makes three attacks: one with its bite and
two with its claws.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 12
(2d8 + 3) piercing damage plus 7 (3d4) acid damage.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10
(2d6 + 3) slashing damage.

***Tail.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 16
(3d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 15
Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

***Salt Spray (Recharge 5â€“6).*** The salt drake releases a spray of razorsharp
salt crystals in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make
a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the target
takes 22 (5d8) acid damage plus 22 (5d8) slashing damage, or half as
much damage on a successful saving throw. In addition, if a creature
takes any damage from the salt spray, it is poisoned until it takes a short
or long rest.
