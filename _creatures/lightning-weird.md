***Electricity.*** If a creature attacks the lighting
weird with a melee weapon, that creature takes 9
(2d8) lightning damage.

***Lightning Mote.*** A lightning weird’s mote is a
crackling, dancing, arcing, ball of electricity that
occupies a 5-foot space. Creatures that start their
turn within 5 feet of the lightning mote take 13
(3d8) lightning damage; creatures wearing metal
armor must make a successful DC 15 Constitution
saving throw if they take lightning damage from being
near the mote. On a failed saving throw, the target is
stunned until the end of its next turn. The lightning can
move its mote up to 30 ft. as a bonus action. The mote
must remain within 90 ft.

***Reform.*** When reduced to 0 hit points, a lightning weird collapses
back into its pool. Four rounds later, it reforms at full strength minus any
damage taken from fire-based attacks and effects (including attacks by
earth or fire elemental creatures).

***Transparent.*** Even when the lightning weird is in plain sight, it takes
a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to spot a lightning weird
that has neither moved nor attacked. A creature that tries to enter the
lightning weird’s space while unaware of the lightning weird is surprised
by the lightning weird.

### Actions

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14
(2d8 + 5) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) lightning damage.

***Command Elemental.*** One air elemental that the lightning weird can
see within 60 feet of it must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On
a failed saving throw, the air elemental is charmed for 1 minute. While
charmed, the air elemental follows the lightning weird’s commands.
