***Fire Form.*** A creature that touches the swarm or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 5 (1d10) fire damage. In addition, the first time the swarm enters a creature's space on a turn, that creature takes 5 (1d10) fire damage and catches fire; until someone uses an action to douse the fire, the creature takes 5 (1d10) fire damage at the start of each of its turns.

***Illumination.*** The swarm sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light to an additional 30 feet.

***Swarm.*** The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny creature. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.

***Water Susceptibility.*** For every 5 feet the swarm moves in water, or for every gallon of water splashed on it, it takes 1 cold damage.

### Actions

***Swarm.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 0 ft., one target in the swarm's space. Hit: 21 (6d6) fire damage, or 10 (3d6) fire damage if the swarm has half or fewer hit points.
