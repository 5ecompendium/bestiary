***Turning Defiance.*** The iron ghoul and any ghouls within 30 feet of it have advantage on saving throws against effects that turn undead.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The iron ghoul makes one bite attack and one claw attack, or three glaive attacks.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (3d8 + 4) piercing damage. If the target is a creature other than an elf or undead, it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If the target is humanoid, it must succeed on a separate DC 13 Constitution saving throw or contract darakhul fever.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (4d6 + 4) slashing damage. If the target is a creature other than an elf or undead, it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If the target is humanoid, it must succeed on a separate DC 13 Constitution saving throw or contract darakhul fever.

***Glaive.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 20 (1d10 + 4) slashing damage.
