***Split.*** The amphisbaena functions normally even if cut
in half. If dealt a critical hit with a slashing weapon,
the creature is cut in half and continues to function
as two separate creatures, each with half of the
original amphisbaena’s current hit points. The
split amphisbaena can rejoin its two halves after
completing a short or long rest. If one of the
split creatures is slain, the amphisbaena can
regrow the lost portion over the course of 1d4 + 2 weeks.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The amphisbaena makes one
bite attack with each of its two heads.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit,
reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3)
piercing damage, and the target must succeed
on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or
become poisoned for 1 hour.
