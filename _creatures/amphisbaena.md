***Split.*** The amphisbaena functions normally even if cut
in half. If dealt a critical hit with a slashing weapon,
the creature is cut in half and continues to function
as two separate creatures, each with half of the
original amphisbaenaâ€™s current hit points. The
split amphisbaena can rejoin its two halves after
completing a short or long rest. If one of the
split creatures is slain, the amphisbaena can
regrow the lost portion over the course of 1d4
+ 2 weeks.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The amphisbaena makes one
bite attack with each of its two heads.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit,
reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3)
piercing damage, and the target must succeed
on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or
become poisoned for 1 hour.
