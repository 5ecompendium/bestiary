***Keen Smell.*** The kamadan has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.

***Pounce.*** If the kamadan moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a claw attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is knocked prone, the kamadan can make two attacks -one with its bite and one with its snakes- against it as a bonus action.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The kamadan makes two attacks: one with its bite or claw and one with its snakes.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (ld6 +3) piercing damage.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.Hit: 6 (ld6 +3) slashing damage.

***Snakes.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 (ld6 +3) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Sleep Breath (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** The kamadan exhales sleep gas in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious for 10 minutes. This effect ends for a creature if it takes damage or someone uses an action to wake it.
