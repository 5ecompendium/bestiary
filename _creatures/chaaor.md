***Magic Resistance.*** The demon has advantage on saving throws against
spells and other magical effects.

***Magic Weapons.*** The demon’s weapon attacks are magical.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The demon’s spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell
save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks). The demon can innately cast the
following spells, requiring no material components:

* At will: <i>darkness, jump, see invisibility</i>

* 1/day: <i>plane shift</i> (self only)

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The demon makes three attacks: one with its bite and two
with its claws.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (3d6 + 8) piercing damage.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (2d8 + 8) slashing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 19). The demon has two claws, each of which can grapple only one target.

***Roar (3/day).*** The demon can emit a loud roar in a 60 radius. Each
creature in the area must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On
a failed saving throw, the target takes 14 (4d6) thunder damage and is
stunned until the end of the demon’s next turn. On a successful saving
throw, the target takes half damage and is not stunned.

***Summon Demon (1/day).*** The demon chooses what to summon and
attempts a magical summoning. A chaaor has a 30% chance of summoning
1d3 vrocks, 1d2 hezrous, or one glabrezu. A summoned demon appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of its summoner, acts as an ally of its summoner, and can’t summon other
demons. It remains for 1 minute, until it or its summoner dies, or until its
summoner dismisses it as an action.
