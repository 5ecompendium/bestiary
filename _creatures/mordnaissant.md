***Death Curse.*** If a mordnaissant dies, it releases a death curse on all
creatures within 30 feet of it. Those creatures must make a DC 15 Wisdom
saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the creature cannot regain hit
points from spending hit dice and it has disadvantage on all saving throws
for 24 hours. A remove curse or greater magic is necessary to end this
curse early.

***Shield of Agony.*** The mordnaissantâ€™s Armor Class includes its Charisma
modifier.

### Actions

***Lash of Fury.*** Ranged Spell Attack: +5 to hit, range 30 ft., one target.
Hit: 24 (5d8 + 2) necrotic damage and the target must make a DC 14
Constitution saving throw or lose 1d4 points of Intelligence. The target
becomes incapacitated if this reduces its Intelligence to 0. The
reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest.

***Pain Wail.*** The mordnaissant releases a wail. Creatures within 20 feet
that can hear the mordnaissant must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw.
On a failed saving throw, the target is stunned until the end of its next turn.
