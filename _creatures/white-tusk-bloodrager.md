***Cold Fury (Recharges after a Short or Long
Rest).*** As a bonus action, the orc can enter a
cold fury for 1 minute. While in a fury, its melee
weapon attacks deal an extra 3 (1d6) damage.
Also, if the orc is reduced to 0 hit points while
in a cold fury, unless it was dealt with a critical
hit, the orc makes a Constitution saving throw
with a DC of 5 plus the damage taken. On a
success, the orc instead drops to 1 hit point and
its fury ends.

***Aggressive.*** As a bonus action, the orc can
move up to its speed toward a hostile creature it
can see.

***Minion: Savage Horde.*** After moving at least 20
feet in a straight line toward a creature, the next
attack the orc makes against that creature scores
a critical hit on a roll of 18â€“20.


### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The White Tusk Bloodrager makes
three falchion attacks.

***Falchion.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5
ft., one target. Hit: 8 (2d4 + 3) slashing damage.
