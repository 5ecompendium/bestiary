***Improved Critical.*** The demon’s attacks score a critical hit on a roll of
19 or 20.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The demon’s spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell
save DC 17, +9 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following
spells requiring no material components:

At will: <i>darkness, detect evil and good, detect magic, mirror image</i>

3/day each: <i>hallow, telekinesis, teleport</i>

***Magic Resistance.*** The demon has advantage on saving throws against
spells and other magical effects.

***Magic Weapons.*** The demon’s weapon attacks are magical.

***Rampage.*** When the demon reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a
melee attack on its turn, the demon can take a bonus action to move up to
half its speed and make a halberd attack.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The demon makes three attacks: one halberd attack and
two sting attacks.

***Halberd.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (2d10 + 8) slashing damage.

***Sting.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (2d8 + 8) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 17 (5d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Summon (1/day).*** The demon chooses what to summon and attempts a
magical summoning.
A gharros has a 50% chance of summoning 1d6 vrocks, 1d4 hezrous,
1d3 glabrezus, 1d2 nalfeshnees, or one marilith.
A summoned demon appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of
its summoner, acts as an ally of its summoner, and can’t summon other
demons. It remains for 1 minute, until it or its summoner dies, or until its
summoner dismisses it as an action.
