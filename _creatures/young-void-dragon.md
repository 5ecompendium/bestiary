***Chill of the Void.*** Cold damage dealt by the void dragon ignores resistance to cold damage, but not cold immunity.

***Void Dweller.*** As ancient void dragon.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The dragon makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d10 + 5) piercing damage plus 3 (1d6) cold damage.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) slashing damage.

***Breath Weapons (Recharge 5-6).*** The dragon uses one of the following breath weapons:

***Gravitic Breath.*** The dragon exhales a 30-foot cube of powerful localized gravity, originating from the dragon.

***Falling damage in the area increases to 1d10 per 10 feet fallen.*** When a creature starts its turn within the area or enters it for the first time in a turn, including when the dragon creates the field, it must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure the creature is restrained. On a success the creature's speed is halved as long as it remains in the field. A restrained creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its turn. The field persists until the dragon's breath recharges, and it can't use gravitic breath twice consecutively.

***Stellar Flare Breath.*** The dragon exhales star fire in a 30- foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 28 (8d6) fire damage and 28 (8d6) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Reactions

***Void Twist.*** When the dragon is hit by a ranged attack it can create a small rift in space to increase its AC by 4 against that attack. If the attack misses because of this increase the dragon can choose a creature within 30 feet to become the new target for that attack. Use the original attack roll to determine if the attack hits the new target.
