***Amphibious.*** The priest can breathe air and water.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The priest's spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 13, +5 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

* At will: <i>command, create or destroy water</i>

* 3/day each: <i>control water, darkness, water breathing, water walk</i>

* 1/day each: <i>call lightning, Evard's black tentacles</i>

### Actions

***Thunderous Touch.*** Melee Spell Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 27 (5d10) thunder damage.

***Voice of the Kraken (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** A kraken speaks through the priest with a thunderous voice audible within 300 feet. Creatures of the priest's choice that can hear the kraken's words (which are spoken in Abyssal, Infernal, or Primordial) must succeed on a DC 14 Charisma saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
