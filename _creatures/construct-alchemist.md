***Weakened Mind.** The alchemist has disadvantage on
Charisma, Intelligence, and Wisdom saving throws.

***Advanced scanners.*** The alchemist uses his mechanical
eye to take in intricate details of his environment
hidden to the human eye. It has truesight out to 30 ft.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The alchemist makes three attacks: two
with its servo-enhanced strike and one with its poison
vial.

***Servo-Enhanced Strike.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit,
reach 5ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning
damage.

***Poison Vial.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, range
20/60 ft., one target. Hit: The target must make a DC
15 Constitution saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) poison
damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one. A creature that fails this saving throw
by 5 or more is poisoned until the end of their next
turn.

***Poison Canister (Recharge 5-6).*** The alchemist launches
a canister filled with deadly poisonous gas at a point
within 30 feet. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere
centered on that point must make a DC 15
Constitution saving throw, taking 38 (7d10) poison
damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one. Creatures that failed the save are also
poisoned for 1 minute. A poisoned creature can repeat
the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending
the poisoned condition on itself on a success.

### Reactions

***Automated Reflexes.*** The alchemist adds 3 to its AC
against one melee attack that would hit it. To use this
feature, the alchemist must see the attacker.

### Legendary Actions

The alchemist can take 3 legendary actions, choosing
from the options below. Only one legendary action can
be used at a time and only at the end of another
creatureâ€™s turn. The alchemist regains spent legendary
actions at the start of its turn.

***Strike.*** The alchemist makes a servo-enhanced strike.

***Poison Burst (Costs 2 Actions).*** The alchemist opens up
a side compartment and unleashes a blast of poisonous
gas against each creature within 10 feet. Each creature
in this area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution
saving throw or take 16 (3d10) poison damage.

***Rapid Repair (Costs 3 Actions).*** The alchemist performs
a swift operation on its damaged component and regains 30 hit points.
