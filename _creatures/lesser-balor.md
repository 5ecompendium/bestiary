half as much damage on a successful one. The
explosion destroys the lesser balor’s weapons.

***Singeing Aura.*** At the start of each of the lesser
balor’s turns, each creature within 5 feet of
it takes 7 (2d6) fire damage. A creature that
touches the lesser balor or hits it with a melee
attack while within 5 feet of it takes 7 (2d6)
fire damage.

***Magic Resistance.*** The lesser balor has advantage on saving throws against spells and other
magical effects.
