***Source.*** tales from the yawning portal,  page 237

***Undead Nature.*** A zombie doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

***Turn Resistance.*** The zombie has advantage on saving throws against any effect that turns undead.

***Undead Fortitude.*** If damage reduces the zombie to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the zombie drops to 1 hit point instead.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The zombie makes two melee attacks.

***Empowered Slam.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage and 7 (2d6) necrotic damage.
