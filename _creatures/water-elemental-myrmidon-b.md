***Magic Weapons.*** The myrmidon's weapon attacks are magical.

### Actions

***Multiattack*** The myrmidon makes three trident attacks.

***Trident*** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage, or 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack.

***Freezing Strikes (Recharge 6)*** The myrmidon uses Multiattack. Each attack that hits deals an extra 5 (1d10) cold damage. A target that is hit by one or more of these attacks has its speed reduced by 10 feet until the end of the myrmidon's next turn.
