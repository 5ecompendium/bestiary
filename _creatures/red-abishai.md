***Devil's Sight.*** Magical darkness doesn't impede the abishai's darkvision.

***Magic Resistance.*** The abishai has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Magic Weapons.*** The abishai's weapon attacks are magical.

### Actions

***Multiattack*** The abishai can use its Frightful Presence. It also makes three attacks: one with its morningstar, one with its claw, and one with its bite.

***Morningstar*** Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (1d8 + 6) piercing damage.

***Claw*** Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (2d10 + 6) slashing damage.

***Bite*** Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 22 (5d10 + 6) piercing damage plus 38 (7d10) fire damage.

***Frightful Presence*** Each creature of the abishai's choice that is within 120 feet and aware of it must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the abishai's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

***Incite Fanaticism*** The abishai chooses up to four of its allies within 60 feet of it that can see it. For 1 minute, each of those allies makes attack rolls with advantage and can't be frightened.

***Power of the Dragon Queen*** The abishai targets one dragon it can see within 120 feet of it. The dragon must make a DC 18 Charisma saving throw. A chromatic dragon makes this save with disadvantage. On a successful save, the target is immune to the abishai's Power of the Dragon Queen for 1 hour. On a failed save, the target is charmed by the abishai for 1 hour. While charmed in this way, the target regards the abishai as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. This effect ends if the abishai or its companions deal damage to the target.
