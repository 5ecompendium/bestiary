ability is Charisma (spell save DC 13, +5 to hit with spell attacks). It can
cast the following spells, requiring no material components.

* At will: <i>mage hand, minor illusion, silent image</i>

* 1/day each: <i>enlarge/reduce, invisibility, major image, see invisibility</i>

***Pack Tactics.*** The mouse dragon has advantage on an attack roll against
a creature if at least one of the dragon’s allies is within 5 feet of the creature
and the ally isn’t incapacitated.

***Treasure Sense.*** The mouse dragon can pinpoint, by scent, the location
of precious metals and stones, such as coins and gems, within 60 feet of it.

***Underfoot.*** The mouse dragon can attempt to hide even when it is
obscured only by a creature that is at least one size larger than it.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The platinum mouse dragon makes one bite attack and
two claw attacks.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7
(1d8 + 3) slashing damage.

***Radiant Breath (Recharge 5–6).*** The dragon exhales radiant light in a
20-foot line that is 1 foot wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC
13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 38 (7d10) radiant damage on a failed
saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one.
