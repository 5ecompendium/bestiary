***360-Degree Vision.*** The rift swine's extra eyes give it advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

***Chaos mutations.*** 50### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The rift swine makes one tusks attack and two tentacle attacks.

***Tentacle.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it is grappled (escape DC 14). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the rift swine can't use this tentacle against another target.
