***Blend With Stone.*** The lythic has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth)
checks in rocky terrain, and can take the Hide action whenever it is within
10 feet of some sort of stone, and remains hidden unless it moves or
attacks.

***Earth Glide.*** The elemental can burrow through nonmagical, unworked
earth and stone. While doing so, the elemental doesnâ€™t disturb the material
it moves through.

***Fury of the Earth.*** Whenever the lythic starts its turn with half its hit
points or fewer, it flies into a berserker-like rage. On each of its turns while
berserk, the lythic deals an additional 7 (2d6) damage with its slam attack.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The lythic makes two slam attacks.

***Slam.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage.
