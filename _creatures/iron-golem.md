***Fire Absorption.*** Whenever the golem is subjected to fire damage, it takes no damage and instead regains a number of hit points equal to the fire damage dealt.

***Immutable Form.*** The golem is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.

***Magic Resistance.*** The golem has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Magic Weapons.*** The golem's weapon attacks are magical.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The golem makes two melee attacks.

***Slam.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 20 (3d8 + 7) bludgeoning damage.

***Sword.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 23 (3d10 + 7) slashing damage.

***Poison Breath (Recharge 5-6).*** The golem exhales poisonous gas in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw, taking 45 (l0d8) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
