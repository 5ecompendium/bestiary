***Mental Fortitude.*** The hatchling has advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened, and magic can't put the hatchling to sleep.

***Spider Climb.*** The hatchling can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

### Actions

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 3 (1d4+1) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
