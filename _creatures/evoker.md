***Spellcasting.*** The evoker is a 12th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 15, +7 to hit with spell attacks). The evoker has the following wizard spells prepared:

Cantrips (at will): <i>fire bolt* , light* , prestidigitation, ray of frost* </i>

1st level (4 slots): <i>burning hands* , mage armor, magic missile* </i>

5th level (2 slots): <i>Bigby's hand* , cone of cold* </i>

6th level (1 slot): <i>chain lightning* , wall of ice* </i>

*Evocation spell

***Sculpt Spells.*** When the evoker casts an evocation spell that forces other creatures it can see to make a saving throw, it can choose a number of them equal to 1+the spell's level. These creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell. If a successful save means a chosen creature would take half damage from the spell, it instead takes no damage from it.

### Actions

***Quarterstaff.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 2 (1d6-1) bludgeoning damage, or 3 (1d8-1) bludgeoning damage if used with two hands.
