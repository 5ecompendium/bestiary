***Slashing Susceptibility.*** If an attack made with a slashing weapon
scores a critical hit on the ice troll, the troll must succeed on a DC 13
Constitution saving throw or lose a limb. Roll a d6. On a roll of 1–3,
the troll loses an arm, and on a roll of 4–6 the troll loses a leg. It is GM’s
choice as to whether it was the right or left arm or leg.

***Regeneration.*** The ice troll regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn.
If the troll is not making physical contact with ice or near-freezing water,
this trait doesn’t function at the start of the troll’s next turn. The cave dies
only if starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn’t regenerate.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The cave troll makes three attacks: one with its bite and
two with its claws.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) cold damage.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8
(1d8 + 4) slashing damage.
