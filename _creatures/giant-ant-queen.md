***Keen Smell.*** The giant ant queen has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.

***Queen's Scent.*** Giant ants defending a queen gain advantage on all attack rolls.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The giant ant queen makes two bite attacks and one sting attack.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage and the target is grappled (escape DC 13). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the giant ant can't bite a different target.

***Sting.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage plus 22 (4d10) poison damage, or half as much poison damage with a successful DC 14 Constitution saving throw.
