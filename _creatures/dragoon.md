its halberd.

ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d10 + 3) slashing damage.

***Skystrike (3/Day).*** As the dragoon returns to the
ground after using its Unnatural Athletics, it
performs a special weapon attack using the pointed
end of its halberd against an enemy within 10 ft. of
the space it landed. On a hit, the target takes takes
15 (1d10 + 2d6 + 3) piercing damage and must

against it are made with disadvantage.
