***Frozen Form.*** The ground within a 15ft. radius
sphere centered on the elemental is considered
difficult terrain as it becomes lightly frozen.
Whenever a creature enters or moves within this
area for the first time on a turn, they must succeed
on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The elemental makes two slam attacks.

***Slam.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5ft.,
one target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage.

***Ice Shard.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, range
30/120 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) piercing
damage and 9 (2d8) cold damage.

***Frost Explosion (Recharge 4-6).*** The elemental sends
out a flurry of frozen shards and snow. Each
creature within the area of the elementalâ€™s Frozen
Form feature must make a DC 14 Constitution
saving throw. On a failure, a target takes 22 (5d8)
cold damage and its movement speed is reduced to
0 until the end of its next turn. If the saving throw
is a success, the target takes no damage and has its
speed halved until the end of its next turn.
