***Amorphous.*** The shroud can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.

***Shadow Evolution.*** Shrouds instantly become shadows once they cause a total of 12 damage. Any damage they've suffered is subtracted from the shadow's total hit points or abilities.

***Shroud Stealth.*** When in dim light or darkness, the shroud can take the Hide action as a bonus action.

***Sunlight Weakness.*** While in sunlight, the shroud has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.

### Actions

***Strength Drain.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 3 (1d4 + 1) necrotic damage, and the target's Strength score is reduced by one-half that amount. The target dies if this reduces its Strength to 0. Otherwise, the reduction lasts until the target finishes a short or long rest. If a non-evil humanoid dies from this attack, a new shadow rises from the corpse 1d4 hours later.
