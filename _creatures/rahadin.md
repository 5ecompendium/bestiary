***Deathly Choir.*** Any creature within 10 feet of Rahadin that isn't protected by a mind blank spell hears in its mind the screams of the thousands of people Rahadin has killed. As a bonus action, Rahadin can force all creatures that can hear the screams to make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. Each creature takes 16 (3d10) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Fey Ancestry.*** Rahadin has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put him to sleep.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** Rahadin's innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 17, +9 to hit with spell attacks). He can innately cast the following spells, requiring no components:

* 3/day: <i>misty step, phantom steed</i>

* 1/day: <i>magic weapon, nondetection</i>

***Mask of the Wild.*** Rahadin can attempt to hide even when he is only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** Rahadin attacks three times with his scimitar, or twice with his poisoned darts.

***Scimitar.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d6+6) slashing damage.

***Poisoned Dart.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d4+6) piercing damage plus 5 (2d4) poison damage.
