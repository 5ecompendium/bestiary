***Charge.*** If the Ravager moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature
and then hits it with a claw attack on the same turn, the target must succeed
on a DC 25 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is
prone, the Ravager can make one claw attack against it as a bonus action.

***Flyby.*** The Ravager doesn’t provoke an opportunity attack when it flies
out of an enemy’s reach.

***Form-Shifting.*** The Ravager can physically alter its physiology to
take on one of the three listed forms: the crawler, the brawler, or the flier.
Doing so takes one minute, and during this period it cannot take any other
actions, though it is not considered incapacitated.

***Improved Critical.*** The Ravager’s bite and claws score a critical hit on
a roll of 19 or 20.

***Legendary Resistance (3/day).*** If the Ravager fails a saving throw, it
can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Disruption.*** Every time the Ravager comes into contact with
magical effects, there is a chance that it disrupts it. This effect functions as
per the dispel magic spell cast using a 5th level spell slot with a +5 spell
casting ability modifier.

***Magic Weapons.*** The Ravager’s melee attacks are magical.

***Rampage.*** When the Ravager reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a
melee attack on its turn, the Ravager can take a bonus action to move up
to half its speed and make a bite attack.

***Regeneration.*** The Ravager regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn.
If the Ravager takes damage from an artifact or from a legendary action,
this trait doesn’t function at the start of the Ravager’s next turn. The
Ravager only dies if it starts its turn at 0 hit points and doesn’t regenerate.

***Vampiric Healing.*** Whenever the Ravager hits with a melee attack, it
regains hit points equal to half the damage it inflicts on its opponent, up to
its hit point maximum.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The Ravager makes one bite and four claw attacks.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +15 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 29
(6d6 + 8) piercing damage.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +15 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit:
36 (8d6 + 8) slashing damage.
