***Rampage.*** When the gnoll reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack on its turn, the gnoll can take a bonus action to move up to half its speed and make a bite attack.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The gnoll makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its shortsword.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d4+2) piercing damage.

***Shortsword.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft, one target. Hit: 5 (1d6+2) piercing damage.

***Sudden Rush.*** Until the end of the turn, the gnoll's speed increases by 60 feet and it doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.
