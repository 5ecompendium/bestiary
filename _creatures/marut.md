***Immutable Form.*** The marut is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The marut's innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence. The marut can innately cast the following spell, requiring no material components.
At will: plane shift (self only)

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the marut fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** The marut has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Actions

***Multiattack*** The marut makes two slam attacks.

***Unerring Slam*** Melee Weapon Attack: automatic hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 60 force damage, and the target is pushed up to 5 feet away from the marut if it is Huge or smaller.

***Blazing Edict (Recharge 5-6)*** Arcane energy emanates from the marut's chest in a 60-foot cube. Every creature in that area takes 45 radiant damage. Each creature that takes any of this damage must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or be stunned until the end of the marut's next turn.

***Justify*** The marut targets up to two creatures it can see within 60 feet of it. Each target must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma saving throw or be teleported to a teleportation circle in the Hall of Concordance in Sigil. A target fails automatically if it is incapacitated. If either target is teleported in this way, the marut teleports with it to the circle.
After teleporting in this way, the marut can't use this action again until it finishes a short or long rest.
