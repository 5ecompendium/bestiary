***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** While in sunlight, Naergoth has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** Naergoth makes three attacks, either with his longsword or longbow. He can use Life Drain in place of one longsword attack.

***Life Drain.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 20 (5d6 + 3) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

***Longsword.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d8 + 5) slashing damage, or 10 (1d10 + 5) if used with two hands, plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage.

***Longbow.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d8 + 1) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage.
