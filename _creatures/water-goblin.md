(spell save DC 13, +5 to hit with spell attacks). The water goblin can
innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

* At will: <i>mending, minor illusion, prestidigitation, ray of frost</i>

* 3/day each: <i>create or destroy water, fog cloud, grease, mage armor, purify food and drink, water breathing</i>

* 1/day: <i>water walk</i>

### Actions

***Scimitar.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) slashing damage.

***Shortbow.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one
target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage.

### Reactions

***Uncanny Dodge.*** When an attacker the water goblin can see hits it with
an attack, it can use its reaction to halve the attack’s damage against it.
