***Foundation of All the World.*** Allies within 60 feet
of the Source cannot be moved against their will or
knocked prone.

### Actions

***Diamondskin.*** As a bonus action, the Source
focuses its gaze on an ally within 30 feet. Diamond
crystals emerge from the target’s skin, increasing
their AC by 2 for 10 minutes, after which the
diamonds turn to worthless dust, restoring the
target’s skin to its previous state.

***Back to Earth.*** The Source focuses its gaze on an
enemy within 30 feet. If the target’s body is made
of flesh, the target must make a DC 15 Constitution
saving throw. On a failed save, the creature magically
begins to turn to stone and is restrained. At
the end of its next turn, it must repeat the saving
throw. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure,
the creature is petrified until freed by the <i>greater
restoration</i> spell or other magic.

***Wall of Stone (1/Day).*** The Source causes a
30-foot-long wall of solid stone to thrust up
through the floor. The wall has six 5-foot-long
panels to it, which can be arranged however the
summoner of the Source wishes, but each segment
must form a line or a right angle with the previous
segment. Each panel is 6 inches thick and 10 feet
high. Each panel has AC 15 and 180 hit points. If
reduced to 0 hit points, a panel crumbles, leaving
loose scree that counts as difficult terrain. The wall
lasts for 10 minutes, then turns to dust.

If the wall is summoned in a creature’s space,
the creature is pushed to one side of the wall,
chosen by the summoner. If a creature would be
surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall
and another solid surface), that creature can make
a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use
its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no
longer enclosed by the wall.
