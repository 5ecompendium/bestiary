***Vulnerability to Salt.*** A handful of salt burns a giant leech
as if it were a flask of acid, causing 1d6 acid damage per use.

### Actions

***Blood Drain.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft. one
creature. Hit: 4 (1d6 + 1) piercing damage, and the leech attaches
to the target. While attached, the leech doesn’t attack. Instead, at the
start of the leech’s turns, the target loses 5 (1d8 + 1) hit points due
to blood loss.

The leech can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement.
It does so after it drains 25 hit points of blood from the target or
the target dies. A creature, including the target, can use its action to
make a DC 10 Strength check to rip the leech off and make it detach.
