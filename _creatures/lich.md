***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the lich fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

***Rejuvenation.*** If it has a phylactery, a destroyed lich gains a new body in 1d10 days, regaining all its hit points and becoming active again. The new body appears within 5 feet of the phylactery.

***Spellcasting.*** The lich is an 18th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 20, +12 to hit with spell attacks). The lich has the following wizard spells prepared:

* Cantrips (at will): <i>mage hand, prestidigitation, ray of frost</i>

* 1st level (4 slots): <i>detect magic, magic missile, shield, thunderwave</i>

* 2nd level (3 slots): <i>detect thoughts, invisibility, Melf's acid arrow, mirror image</i>

* 3rd level (3 slots): <i>animate dead, counterspell, dispel magic, fireball</i>

* 4th level (3 slots): <i>blight, dimension door</i>

* 5th level (3 slots): <i>cloudkill, scrying</i>

* 6th level (1 slot): <i>disintegrate, globe of invulnerability</i>

* 7th level (1 slot): <i>finger of death, plane shift</i>

* 8th level (1 slot): <i>dominate monster, power word stun</i>

* 9th level (1 slot): <i>power word kill</i>

***Turn Resistance.*** The lich has advantage on saving throws against any effect that turns undead.

### Actions

***Paralyzing Touch.*** Melee Spell Attack: +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 10 (3d6) cold damage. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

### Legendary Actions

The lich can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time, and only at the end of another creature's turn. The lich regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

***Cantrip.*** The lich casts a cantrip.

***Paralyzing Touch (Costs 2 Actions).*** The lich uses its Paralyzing Touch.

***Frightening Gaze (Costs 2 Actions).*** The lich fixes its gaze on one creature it can see within 10 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or become frightened for 1 minute. The frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to the lich's gaze for the next 24 hours.

***Disrupt Life (Costs 3 Actions).*** Each non-undead creature within 20 feet of the lich must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw against this magic, taking 21 (6d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
