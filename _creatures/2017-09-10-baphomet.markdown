At will: detect magic

3/day each: dispel magic, dominate beast, hunter's mark, maze, wall of stone

1/day each: teleport

***Magic Resistance.*** Baphomet has advantage on saving throws against spell and other magic effects.

***Magic Weapon.*** Baphomet's weapon attacks are magical

***Reckless.*** At the start of his turn, Baphomet can gain advantage on all melee weapon attack rolls during that turn, but attack rolls against him have advantage until the start of his next turn.

**Actions**

***Multiattack.*** Baphomet makes three attacks: one with Heartcleaver, one with his bite, and one with his gore attack.

***Heartcleaver.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +17 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 24 (4d6 + 10) slashing damage

***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of Baphomet's choice within 120 feet of him and aware of him must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. These later saves have disadvantage if Baphomet is within line of sight of the creature.

If a creature succeeds on any of these saves or the effect ends on it, the creature is immune is Baphomet's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.
