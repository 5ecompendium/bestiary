***Brave.*** A kathlin has advantage on saving throws against being
frightened.

***Great Endurance.*** A kathlin can run at a gallop for up to 4 hours before
succumbing to exhaustion.

***Trampling Charge.*** If the kathlin moves at least 20 feet straight toward
a creature and then hits it with a hooves attack on the same turn, that target
must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If
the target is prone, the kathlin can make another attack with its hooves
against it as a bonus action.

### Actions

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d4 + 4) piercing damage.

***Hooves.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13
(2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.
