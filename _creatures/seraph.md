***Heat.*** A seraph’s body generates heat. Creatures who touch the genie
take 7 (2d6) fire damage. If the seraph genie uses a metal weapon adds this
additional damage to the weapon’s attacks. A seraph genie can suppress
this effect for 1 hour as a bonus action.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** A seraph genie’s innate spellcasting ability is
charisma (spell save DC 15, +7 to hit with spell attacks). It can cast the
following spells without requiring material components.

* At will: <i>detect evil and good, detect magic, flame blade, plane shift </i>(self only)<i>, produce flame</i>

* 3/day each: <i>fireball, flame strike, invisibility, see invisibility, wall of fire</i>

* 1/day each: <i>fire storm, greater invisibility</i>

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** A seraph genie makes three scimitar attacks.

***Scimitar.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7
(1d6 + 4) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) fire damage.

***Fire Burst (Recharge 5–6).*** The seraph genie emits a blast of elemental
fire in a 30-foot radius. All creatures in the area must make a DC 15
Dexterity saving throw, taking 28 (8d6) fire damage on a failed saving
throw, or half as much on a successful one.
