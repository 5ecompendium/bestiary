***Amphibious.*** The merfolk can breathe air and water.

***Aquatic Travel.*** The merfolk uses surges of conjured
water to propel its body forward when on land, allowing
it to move rapidly despite its lack of standard ground
travel.

***Spellcasting.*** The merfolk is a 12th-level spellcaster. Its
spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 16, +8
to hit with spell attacks). It has the following Wizard
spells prepared:

* Cantrips (at will): <i>dancing lights, frostbite, shape water</i>

* 1st level (4 slots): <i>comprehend languages, shield, silent image</i>

* 2nd level (3 slots): <i>blur, hold person</i>

* 3rd level (3 slots): <i>tidal wave, wall of water</i>

* 4th level (3 slots): <i>control water, greater invisibility, watery sphere</i>

* 5th level (2 slots): <i>cone of cold, dominate person</i>

* 6th level (1 slots): <i>globe of invulnerability, otilukeâ€™s freezing sphere</i>

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The merfolk makes two attacks with its
staff.

***Staff.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5ft., one
target. Hit: 6 (1d8 + 2) bludgeoning damage plus 14
(3d8) cold damage.

***Torrent of Water.*** Target creature within 60 feet must
succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 33
(6d10) cold damage as a powerful torrent of freezing
water flows over them. If a creature fails this saving
throw by 10 or more, its movement speed is reduced
to 10 ft. on its next turn.

***Tether of the Tides (Recharge 5-6).*** The merfolk binds
two targets together with a stream of ice cold water. If
either target tries to move more than 20 feet away
from its bound partner, it must expend 2 feet of
movement for every 1 foot traveled and it takes 11
(2d10) cold damage for every 5 feet traveled.
