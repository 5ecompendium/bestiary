***Keen Smell.*** The jaguar has advantage on Wisdom
(Perception) checks that rely on smell.

***Pounce.*** If the jaguar moves at least 20 feet straight toward
a creature and then hits it with a claw attack on the same turn,
that target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be
knocked prone. If the target is prone, the jaguar can make one bite
attack against it as a bonus action.

***Surprise Attack.*** If the sabertooth jaguar surprises a creature and hits
it with an attack during the first round of combat, the target takes an
extra 10 (3d6) damage from the attack.

### Actions

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 27
(4d10 + 5) piercing damage.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12
(2d6 + 5) slashing damage.
