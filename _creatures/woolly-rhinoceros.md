***Improved Critical.*** Gore attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.

***Keen Smell.*** The woolly rhinoceros has advantage on Wisdom
(Perception) checks that rely on smell.

***Charge.*** If the woolly rhinoceros moves at least 20 feet straight toward
a creature and then hits it with a gore attack on the same turn, the target
takes an extra 9 (2d8) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must
succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the
target is prone, the woolly rhinoceros can make one stomp attack against
it as a bonus action.
