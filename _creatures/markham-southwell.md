### Roleplaying Information

Sheriff Markham of Bryn Shander is a brawny, likable man of few words. Nothing is more important to him than protecting Icewind Dale. He judges others by their actions, not their words.

**Ideal:** "All people deserve to be treated with dignity."

**Bond:** "Duvessa is a natural leader, but she needs help. That's my job."

**Flaw:** "I bury my emotions and have no interest in small talk."
