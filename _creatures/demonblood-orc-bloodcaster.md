***Blood Magic.*** Whenever the orc deals damage to an
enemy with a spell, it gains 5 temporary hit points.
Additionally, the orc can use its bonus action to pay
1d10 hit points to make the next spell it casts act
as if it were cast at one spellslot higher.

***Uncontainable Power.*** When the orc dies, it
explodes violently. Each creature within 5 feet of it
must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking
18 (4d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half
as much damage on a successful one.

***Spellcasting.*** The orc is an 7th-level spellcaster. Its
spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14,

* 1st level (4 slots): <i>burning hands, mage armor, shield</i>
