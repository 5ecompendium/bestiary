***Undead Fortitude.*** If damage reduces the zombie
to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving
throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless
the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a
success, the zombie drops to 1 hit point instead.

***Water Poisoner.*** Water within 20 ft. of the zombie
is tainted with toxins . A creature that enters or
starts its turn in that water must succeed on a DC
15 Constitution saving throw or it is poisoned until
the start of its next turn.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The zombie can make two attacks:
one with its bite and one with its tail.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft.,
one target. Hit: 28 (4d10 + 6) piercing damage. If
the target is a creature, it is grappled (Escape DC 16). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained,
and the sarcosuchus zombie canâ€™t grapple an other target.

***Tail.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 15 ft.,
one target. Hit: 19 (3d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage. If
the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17
Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
