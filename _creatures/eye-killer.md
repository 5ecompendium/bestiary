***Sunlight Vulnerability.*** If a source of sunlight is brought within 5 feet
of the eye killer, the eye killer becomes frightened for 1 minute. While
frightened, the eye killer must end any grapple it is maintaining and use
its action to Dash away from the source of sunlight.

### Actions

***Tail Slap.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit:
14 (2d10 + 3) bludgeoning damage and the target is grappled (escape DC
13). At the beginning of each of the eye killerâ€™s turns, a grappled creature
takes 14 (2d10 + 3) bludgeoning damage.

***Death Ray (1/day).*** If the eye killer begins its turn within an area of
bright light or dim light, it can immediately douse that source of light if it
is created by a spell of 3rd level or lower. When it does so, it absorbs and
redirects the light in a 60-foot line that is 5 feet across. Creatures in the
area must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed saving throw,
the target drops to 0 hit points and begins dying. On a successful saving
throw, the target takes 10 (3d6) radiant damage.
