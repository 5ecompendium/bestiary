***Innate Spellcasting.*** A shadhavar's innate spellcasting ability score is Charisma (spell save DC 13). It can cast the following spells, requiring no components:

* At will: <i>disguise self </i>(as horse or unicorn only)

* 2/day: <i>darkness </i>(centered on itself, moves with the shadhavar)

***Magic Weapons.*** A shadhavar's gore attacks are magical.

***Shadesight.*** A shadhavar's darkvision functions in magical darkness.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** A shadhavar makes one gore attack and one hooves attack.

***Gore.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage.

***Hooves.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (3d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage.

### Bonus Actions

***Plaintive Melody (3/day).*** A shadhavar plays a captivating melody through its hollow horn. Creatures within 60 feet that can hear the shadhavar must make a successful DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed until the start of the shadhavar's next turn. A creature charmed in this way is incapacitated, its speed is reduced to 0, and a shadhavar has advantage on attack rolls against it.
