***Crystalline Mandibles.*** The caterprism’s mandibles ignore resistance to
slashing damage. In addition, when the caterprism attacks a creature with
at least one head with its bite attack and rolls a natural 20 on the attack
roll, it cuts off one of the creature’s heads. The creature dies if it cannot
survive without the lost head. A creature is immune to this ability if it is
immune to slashing damage, doesn’t have or need a head, has legendary
actions, or the GM decides that the creature is too big for the head to be
cut off with this attack. Such a creature instead takes an extra 27 (6d8)
slashing damage from the hit.

***Tunneler.*** Caterprism can burrow through solid rock at 5 feet per round
leaving a 5 foot-wide, 8-foot-high tunnel in its wake.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The caterprism makes one bite and two claw attacks.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d8 +5) slashing damage. If the caterprism scores a critical hit, it rolls
damage dice four times, instead of twice.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target Hit: 16 (2d10 + 5) slashing damage.

***Crystal Breath Recharge (5–6).*** The caterprism spews forth a
crystalline silk-like substance in a 30-foot cone that instantly hardens into
razor-sharp crystalline spears. Each creature in that area must make a DC
15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 28 (8d6) piercing damage on a failed
save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
