***Yip.*** Doombats constantly yip while in combat, and the noise interferes
with the concentration of those attempting to cast spells. All creatures
within a 30-foot radius that are maintaining concentration on a spell when
the doombat yips must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or
lose concentration on that spell.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The doombat makes one bite attack and one tail attack.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13
(2d8 + 4) piercing damage.

***Tail.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 8
(1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.

***Shriek (Recharge 5â€“6).*** The doombat emits a piercing shriek. All
creatures within a 60-foot radius must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving
throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw
at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
