***Spider Climb.*** The spider can climb difficult surfaces, including upside
down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

***Web Sense.*** While in contact with a web, the spider knows the exact
location of any other creature in contact with the same web.

***Web Walker.*** The spider ignores movement restrictions caused by
webbing.

### Actions

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage, and the target must attempt a DC 13 Constitution
