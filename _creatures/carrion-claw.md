***Spider Climb.*** The carrion claw can climb difficult surfaces, including
upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

***Magical Light Sensitivity.*** While in magical light, the carrion claw has
disadvantage on attack rolls, and opponents have advantage on attack rolls
against it.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The carrion claw makes one bite attack and three claw
attacks.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11

turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
