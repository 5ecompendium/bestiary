***Innate Spellcasting.*** The gooseâ€™s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma. It can innately cast the following spells (spell save DC 15), requiring no material or somatic components:

* At will: <i>arcane lock, shatter, fear, thunderous smite, wrathful smite</i>

* 1/day each: <i>divine word, etherealness, power word stun</i>

***Evasive.*** When the goose is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.

***Nimble Escape.*** The goose can take the Disengage or Hide action as a bonus action on each of its turns.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The goose uses its Honk, then makes three attacks with its Beak.

***Beak.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) psychic damage.

***Honk.*** All creatures of the goose's choice within 120 ft. that can hear it must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a fail, the creature is enraged, having disadvantage on attacks against any target other than the goose until the end of the goose's next turn.
