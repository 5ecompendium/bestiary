***Blatant Dismissal.*** While in a fey court or castle, a monolith champion that scores a successful hit with its greatsword can try to force the substitution of the target with a shadow double. The target must succeed at a DC 14 Charisma saving throw or become invisible, silent, and paralyzed, while an illusory version of itself remains visible and audible.and under the monolith champion's control, shouting for a retreat or the like. Outside fey locales, this ability does not function.

***Fey Flame.*** The ritual powering a monolith champion grants it an inner flame that it can use to enhance its weapon or its fists with additional fire or cold damage, depending on the construct's needs.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The champion makes two greatsword attacks or two slam attacks.

***Greatsword.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (3d6 + 4) slashing damage plus 11 (2d10) cold or fire damage.

***Slam.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 11 (2d10) cold or fire damage.
