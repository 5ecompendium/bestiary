***Spider Climb.*** The dissimortuum can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The dissimortuum makes three claw attacks.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (3d8 + 2) slashing damage.

***Terrifying Mask.*** Each non-undead creature within 60 feet of the dissimortuum that can see it must make a successful DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1d8 rounds.
