***Shapechanger.*** As an action, the dragon can polymorph
into a Small or Medium humanoid or back
into its true form. Its statistics, other than its size,
are the same in each form. Any worn or carried
equipment isn’t transformed. It reverts to its true
form if it dies.

***Magic Resistance.*** The dragon has advantage
on saving throws against spells and other
magical effects.

***False Appearance.*** While the dragon remains
motionless, it is indistinguishable from a shrub or
small tree of blooming oleander.

### Actions

***Implant Nightmare.*** The dragon reaches into the
mind of a target it can see within 60 feet and manifests
the target’s deepest fear. The target must
make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed
save, the target becomes frightened for 1 minute.
At the start of each of the target’s turns, the target
must repeat the saving throw or take 22 (4d10)
psychic damage. On a successful save, the nightmare
ends.

***Pollen Breath (Recharge 5–6).*** The dragon exhales
a swirling cloud of pollen and red and purple petals
in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in the area must
make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed
save, the creature becomes charmed until the
end of their next round. Creatures who successfully
save cannot be affected by Pollen Breath for
24 hours.

***Song of Cestilani (1/Day).*** The oleander dragon
sings a magical song. Each enemy that can hear
it must succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence saving
throw or take 22 (4d8 + 4) psychic damage and
be stunned for 1 minute. A creature can repeat this
saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending
the effect on itself on a success.
