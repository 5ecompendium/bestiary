***Trampling Charge.*** If the zombie moves at least 20
feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with
a gore attack on the same turn, that target must
succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be
knocked prone. If the target is prone, the zombie
can make one stomp attack against it as a bonus
action.

***Undead Fortitude.*** If damage reduces the zombie
to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving
throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless
the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a
success, the zombie drops to 1 hit point instead.

### Actions

***Gore.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft.,
one target. Hit: 24 (4d8 + 6) piercing damage.

***Stomp.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft.,
one prone creature. Hit: 22 (3d10 + 6) bludgeoning
damage.
