***Immutable Form.*** The algorith is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The algorith's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 16). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

At will: aid, blur, detect magic, dimension door

5/day each: dispel magic

1/day: commune (5 questions), wall of force

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The algorith makes two logic razor attacks.

***Logic Razor.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 31 (4d12 + 5) force damage.

***Cone of Negation (Recharge 5-6).*** An algorith can project a cone of null energy. Targets inside the 30 foot cone take 42 (12d6) force damage and suffer the effect of a dispel magic spell. A successful DC 16 Dexterity saving throw reduces the damage to half and negates the dispel magic effect on that target.

***Reality Bomb (5/Day).*** The algorith can summon forth a tiny rune of law and throw it as a weapon. Any creature within 30 feet of the square where the reality bomb lands takes 21 (6d6) force damage and is stunned until the start of the algorith's next turn. A target that makes a successful DC 16 Dexterity saving throw takes half damage and isn't stunned.
