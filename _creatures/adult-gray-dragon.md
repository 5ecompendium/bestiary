***Amphibious.*** The dragon can breathe air and water.

***Legendary Resistance (3/day).*** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it
can choose to succeed instead.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The dragon uses its Frightful Presence and makes three
attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 18
(2d10 + 7) piercing damage plus 5 (1d10) fire damage.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 14
(2d6 + 7) slashing damage.

***Tail.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 16
(2d8 + 7) bludgeoning damage.

***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of the dragon’s choice that is within
120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom
saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the
saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on
a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful of the effect ends for
it, the creature is immune to the dragon’s Frightful Presence for the next
24 hours.

***Steam Breath (Recharge 5–6).*** The dragon exhales steam in a 60 cone.
Creatures in the area must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw. On
a failed saving throw, the creature takes 63 (18d6) fire damage, or half as
much damage on a successful saving throw. Being underwater doesn’t
grant resistance to this damage.

### Legendary Actions

The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options
below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only
at the end of another creature’s turn. The dragon regains spent legendary
actions at the start of its turn.

***Detect.*** The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.

***Tail Attack.*** The dragon makes a tail attack.

***Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).*** The dragon beats its wings. Each
creature within 15 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 24 Dexterity
saving throw or take 14 (2d6 + 7) bludgeoning damage and be knocked
prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.
