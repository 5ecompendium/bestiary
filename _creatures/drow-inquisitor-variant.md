***Discern Lie.*** The drow knows when she hears a creature speak a lie in a language she knows.

***Fey Ancestry.*** The drow has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put the drow to sleep.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The drow's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma. She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:
* At will: dancing lights, detect magic
* 1/day each: clairvoyance, darkness, detect thoughts, dispel magic, faerie fire , levitate (self only), suggestion

***Magic Resistance.*** The drow has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Spellcasting.*** The drow is a 12th-level spellcaster. Her spellcasting ability is Wisdom. She has the following cleric spells prepared:
* Cantrips (at will): guidance, message, poison spray, resistance, thaumaturgy
* 1st level (4 slots): bane, cure wounds, inflict wounds
* 2nd level (3 slots): blindness/deafness, silence, spiritual weapon
* 3rd level (3 slots): bestow curse, dispel magic, magic circle
* 4th level (3 slots): banishment, divination, freedom of movement
* 5th level (2 slots): contagion, dispel evil and good, insect plague
* 6th level (1 slot): harm, true seeing

***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** While in sunlight, the drow has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

### Actions

***Multiattack*** The drow makes three death lance attacks.

***Death Lance*** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d6 + 5) piercing damage plus 18 (4d8) necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage it takes. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0.

***Summon Demon (1/Day)*** The drow attempts to magically summon a yochlol, with a 50 percent chance of success. If the attempt fails, the drow takes 5 (1d10) psychic damage. Otherwise, the summoned demon appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of its summoner, acts as an ally of its summoner, and can't summon other demons. It remains for 10 minutes, until it or its summoner dies, or until its summoner dismisses it as an action. (see notes for link)
