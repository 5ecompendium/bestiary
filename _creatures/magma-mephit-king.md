***Death Burst.*** When the mephit dies, it explodes in a
burst of lava. Each creature within 5 feet of it must
make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22
(4d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much
damage on a successful one.

***False Appearance.*** While the mephit remains
motionless, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary
mound of magma.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The mephit makes two attacks with its
claws or with its bow.

***Magma Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit,
reach 5ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing
damage plus 5 (1d10) fire damage.

***Magma Bow.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range
80/320 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing
damage plus 5 (1d10) fire damage.

***Molten Caltrops.*** The mephit scatters molten
caltrops in a 15-foot square around itself. This area
is considered difficult terrain and creatures take 7
(2d6) fire damage for every 5 feet they move
through this terrain.

***Lava Choke (Recharge 6).*** The mephit causes a ball
of lava to appear in the throat of a creature it can
see within 90 ft. That creature must make a DC 13
Constitution saving throw, taking 27 (5d10) fire
damage on a failed save and the creature is silenced
as their throat is charred, or half as much damage
and not silenced on a successful save. The silence
lasts until the creature takes a short rest or is
healed by lesser restoration or similar magic.
