***Flyby.*** The sabrewing doesn’t provoke an opportunity attack when it
flies out of an enemy’s reach.

***Magic Weapons.*** The sabrewing’s weapon attacks are magical.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The sabrewing makes two attacks with its wings.

***Wings.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14
(2d8 + 5) slashing damage, and the target begins bleeding out. While the
target is bleeding out, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving
throw at the beginning of its turns, or its maximum hit points are reduced
by 7 (2d6). Bleeding out continues until the target or another creature uses
an action to make a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check, or if the
target receives magical healing.
