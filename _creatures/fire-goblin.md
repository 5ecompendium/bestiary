***Flaming Arrows.*** Fire goblins are adept at manufacturing flaming
arrows, and coupled with their produce flame cantrip, a fire goblin with
prepared arrows (wrapped and treated to be easily flammable) may set
up to 2 arrows on fire as a seamless part of each turn’s attack, without
requiring a separate action. Preparing an arrow for such a use still takes
the normal amount of time but can be done in advance and saved for a
later battle.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The fire goblin’s spellcasting ability is Intelligence
(spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks). The fire goblin can innately
cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

* At will: <i>fire bolt, produce flame</i>

* 3/day each: <i>burning hands, flame blade, flaming sphere, heat metal</i>

* 1/day: <i>fireball, wall of fire</i>

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The fire goblin can make two attacks with its flaming
arrows using its shortbow.

***Battleaxe.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d8 + 2) slashing damage, or 7 (1d10 + 2) slashing damage if used with two hands.

***Shortbow.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one
target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) fire damage.

***Fire Breath (Recharge 5–6).*** The goblin exhales fire in a 20-foot cone.
Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw,
taking 45 (10d8) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on
a successful one.
