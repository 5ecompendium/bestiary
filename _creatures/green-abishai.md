***Devil's Sight.*** Magical darkness doesn't impede the abishai's darkvision.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The abishai's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma. It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:
* At will: alter self, major image
* 3/day each: charm person, detect thoughts, fear
* 1/day each: confusion, dominate person, mass suggestion

***Magic Resistance.*** The abishai has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Magic Weapons.*** The abishai's weapon attacks are magical. Actions

***Multiattack.*** The abishai makes two attacks, one with its claws and one with its longsword, or it casts one spell from its Innate Spellcasting trait and makes one claw attack.

***Longsword.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d8 + 1) slashing damage, or 6 (1d10 + 1) slashing damage if used with two hands.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 11 (2d10) poison damage and become poisoned for 1 minute. The poisoned target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
