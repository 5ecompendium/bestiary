***Siege Monster.*** The treant deals double damage to objects and structures.

***Treespeech.*** A weeping treant can converse with plants, and most plants greet them with a friendly or helpful attitude.

***Acidic Tears.*** Thick tears of dark sap stream continuously down the treant's face and trunk. These tears are highly acidic - anyone who attacks the treant from a range of 5 feet or less must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 6 (1d12) acid damage from splashed tears. This acidic matter continues doing 6 (1d12) acid damage at the start of each of the creature's turns until it or an adjacent ally uses an action to wipe off the tears or three rounds elapse.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The treant makes three slam attacks.

***Slam.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., single target. Hit: 15 (3d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage.

***Rock.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, range 60/180 ft., one target. Hit: 21 (3d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage.
