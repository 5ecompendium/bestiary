***Keen Hearing and Smell.*** The prehistoric honey badger has
advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks based on
hearing or smell.

***Relentless (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** If the
badger takes 14 damage or less that would reduce it to 0
hit points, it is reduced to 1 hit point instead.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The prehistoric honey badger makes one bite attack and
one crunch attack.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 16
(2d10 + 5) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 15 Strength
saving throw or be grappled (escape DC 15).

***Crunch.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one grappled
creature. Hit: The target suffers from broken bones and must make a DC
15 Constitution saving throw at the beginning of each of its turns. On a
failed saving throw, the target cannot take any actions or reactions during
that turn. If the target receives magical healing or takes a long rest, the
effect ends.
