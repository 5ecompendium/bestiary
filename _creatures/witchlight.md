***Dispel Magic Weakness.*** Casting dispel magic on a witchlight paralyzes it for 1d10 rounds.

***Luminance.*** A witchlight normally glows as brightly as a torch. The creature can dim itself to the luminosity of a candle, but it cannot extinguish its light. Because of its glow, the witchlight has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

***Thin As Light.*** While a witchlight is not incorporeal, it can pass through any opening that light can.

### Actions

***Light Ray.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, range 30 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d4 + 4) radiant damage.

***Flash (Recharge 5-6).*** The witchlight emits a bright burst of light that blinds all sighted creatures within 30 feet for 1d4 rounds unless they succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw.
