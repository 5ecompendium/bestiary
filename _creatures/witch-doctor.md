***Innate Spellcasting.*** The witch doctorâ€™s innate
spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 14).
The witch doctor can innately cast the following
spells, requiring no material components:

* 3/day each: <i>darkness, hex, hellish rebuke</i>

* 1/day each: <i>counterspell, fear, magic circle</i>

***Totemic Ritualist.*** Whenever the witch doctor uses
its action to cast a spell, it may use its bonus action
to conjure a totem if able.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The witch doctor conjures a totem is
able. It then makes two attacks with its claws or
two with its blowgun.

***Dagger.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5ft.,
one target. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage.

***Blowgun.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range
20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing
damage plus 14 (4d6) poison damage.

***Conjure Totem (Recharge 4-6).*** The Witch Doctor
creates a powerful, magical totem in an unoccupied
space within 30 feet. This totem is a tiny object
with 15 hit points and AC 12. The totem provides
bonuses to the witch doctor and its allies until
destroyed. The witch doctor may only have one
totem of each type active at a time. When the witch
doctor summons a totem it chooses from the
following options:
* ***Invigorating Totem.*** On initiative count 20
(losing ties), evil creatures within 30 feet of the
totem regain 5 (1d10) hit points.
* ***Empowering Totem.*** Evil creatures within 30
feet of the totem deal an additional 5 (1d10)
force damage on all weapon attacks.
* ***Impeding Totem.*** The area within 30 feet of the
totem is considered difficult terrain for non-evil
creatures.
