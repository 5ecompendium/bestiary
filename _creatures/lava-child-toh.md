***Heated Body.*** A creature that touches the lava child or hits it with a
melee attack while within 5 ft. of it takes 7 (2d6) fire damage.

***Metal Immunity.*** Lava children are unaffected by metal. They can walk
through solid metal doors as if the door wasnâ€™t there. Metal weapons, even
magical, have no effect on lava children. Lava children make all attacks
with advantage against foes wearing metal armor.

***Water Vulnerability.*** For every 1 gallon of water splashed on the lava
child, it takes 3 cold damage.

### Actions

its claws.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d6 + 1) piercing damage.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5
(1d8 + 1) slashing damage.
