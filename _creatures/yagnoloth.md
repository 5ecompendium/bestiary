***Innate Spellcasting.*** The yagnoloth's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma. It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:
* At will: darkness, detect magic, dispel magic, invisibility (self only), suggestion
* 3/day: lightning bolt

***Magic Resistance.*** The yagnoloth has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Magic Weapons.*** The yagnoloth's weapon attacks are magical.

### Actions

***Multiattack*** The yagnoloth makes one massive arm attack and one electrified touch attack, or it makes one massive arm attack and teleports before or after the attack.

***Electrified Touch*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 27 (6d8) lightning damage.

***Massive Arm*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 23 (3d12 + 4) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or is stunned until the end of the yagnoloth's next turn.

***Life Leech*** The yagnoloth touches one incapacitated creature within 15 feet of it. The target takes 36 (7d8 + 4) necrotic damage, and the yagnoloth gains temporary hit points equal to half the damage dealt. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest, and the target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0.

***Battlefield Cunning (Recharge 4-6)*** Up to two allied yugoloths within 60 feet of the yagnoloth that can hear it can use their reactions to make one melee attack each.

***Teleport*** The yagnoloth magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.
