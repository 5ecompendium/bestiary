***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** While in sunlight, the chupacabra has
disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception)
checks that rely on sight.

### Actions

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7
(2d4 + 2) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed
on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

***Drain Blood.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature
that is prone, incapacitated, or restrained. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) necrotic
damage. Additionally, the targetâ€™s hit point maximum is reduced by
an amount equal to the damage taken, and the chupacabra regains
hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target
finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point
maximum to 0.

### Reactions

***Pin.*** If a creature within 5 feet of the chupacabra stands up, the
chupacabra can use its reaction to make a bite attack.
