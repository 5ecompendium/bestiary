***Everchanging Changers.*** The Court of All Flesh are
beings of pure chaos. Because their minds are pure
disorder, they cannot be driven mad or charmed
and any attempts to magically compel their behavior fails.

***Formless Shape.*** Vastikan is immune to any
spell or effect that would alter his form.

***Formkiller.*** If Vastikan hits a target with three
or more arrows in one round, the target must make
a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or lose its
native form. Roll on the Reincarnation table to
determine the targetâ€™s new form. The target
reverts to its original form after 1 hour.
 A target that succeeds on its saving throw becomes
immune to Formkiller for 24 hours.

### Actions
