***Innate Spellcasting.*** The lynx's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma. It can cast the following spell, requiring no material components:

3/day: gaseous form

***Smoky Constitution.*** The vapor lynx spends its time in both gaseous and solid form. Its unique constitution makes it immune to all fog- or gas-related spells and attacks, including its own. A vapor lynx sees clearly through light or heavy obscurement caused by fog, mist, or spells such as fog cloud.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The vapor lynx makes one bite attack and two claw attacks.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (3d8 + 4) piercing damage.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage.

***Poison Breath (Recharge 5-6).*** The vapor lynx exhales a 40- foot radius poison fog, which heavily obscures a spherical area around the lynx. Any breathing creature that ends its turn in the fog must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1d4 + 1 rounds.
