***Cavalry Training.*** When the duergar hits a target with a melee attack while mounted on a female steeder, the steeder can make one melee attack against the same target as a reaction.

***Duergar Resilience.*** The duergar has advantage on saving throws against poison, spells, and illusions, as well as to resist being charmed or paralyzed.

***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** While in sunlight, the duergar has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

### Actions

***Multiattack*** The duergar makes two war pick attacks.

***War Pick*** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage plus 5 (2d4) poison damage.

***Heavy Crossbow*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +2 to hit, range 100/400 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d10) piercing damage.

***Shared Invisibility (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest)*** The duergar magically turns invisible for up to 1 hour or until it attacks, it casts a spell, or its concentration is broken (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment the duergar wears or carries is invisible with it. While the invisible duergar is mounted on a female steeder, the steeder is invisible as well. The invisibility ends early on the steeder immediately after it attacks.
