***Legendary Resistance (3/day).*** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can
choose to succeed instead.

***Spell Reflection.*** Any time the glass wyrm is targeted by a magic
missile spell, a line spell, or a spell that requires a ranged attack roll, roll a
d6. On a 1 to 5, the dragon is unaffected. On a 6, the dragon is unaffected,
and the effect is reflected back at the caster as though it originated from
the dragon, turning the caster into the target.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The glass wyrm uses its blinding reflection ability, and
makes one bite attack and two claw attacks.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d8 + 6) piercing damage.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (2d10 + 6) slashing damage.

***Blinding Reflection.*** The glass wyrm reflects available light in a burst of radiance out to a
30-foot radius. Creatures that can see the glass wyrm in the area must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A blinded creature can attempt a DC 17 Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the blinded condition on a success.

The glass wyrm can’t use this ability if it does not begin its turn within
the dim light or bright light radius of a light source.

***Glass Shards (Recharge 5–6).*** The glass wyrm breaths a 40-foot cone
of glass razor-like glass shards. Creatures in the area must succeed on a
DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 54 (12d8) piercing damage on a
failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one.
