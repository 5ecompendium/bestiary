***Special Equipment.*** The dragon is attuned to a crystal ball, which is
hidden somewhere within its labyrinthine lair. If a dungeon dragon loses
its crystal ball, it can create a new one over the course of 10 days.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The dungeon dragon’s innate spellcasting ability
is Charisma (spell save DC 18, +10 to hit with spell attacks). It can cast
the following spells, requiring no material components.

* At will: <i>alarm, arcane lock, detect magic, detect thoughts, find traps, glyph of warding, identify, knock, scrying, stone shape, wall of stone</i>

* 3/day each: <i>dispel magic, hallucinatory terrain, locate creature, locate object, project image</i>

***Labyrinthine Recall.*** The dungeon dragon can perfectly recall any path
it has traveled.

***Legendary Resistance (3/day).*** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can
choose to succeed instead.

***Trap Master.*** The dungeon dragon has advantage on saving throws
against the effects of traps.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The dragon uses its Frightful Presence and makes three
attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 19
(2d10 + 8) piercing damage.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 15
(2d6 + 8) slashing damage.

***Tail.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 17
(2d8 + 8) bludgeoning damage.

***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of the dragon’s choice that is within
120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom
saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the
saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on
a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for
it, the creature is immune to the dragon’s Frightful Presence for the next
24 hours.

***Confusion Breath (Recharge 5–6).*** The dragon exhales gas in a 60-foot
cone that spreads around corners. Each creature in that area must succeed
on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is
confused for 1 minute. While confused, the creature uses its action to
Dash in a random direction, even if that movement takes the creature into
dangerous areas. A confused creature can repeat the saving throw at the
end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

### Legendary Actions

The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options
below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only
at the end of another creature’s turn. The dragon regains spent legendary
actions at the start of its turn.

***Detect.*** The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.

***Tail Attack.*** The dragon makes a tail attack.

***Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).*** The dragon beats its wings. Each
creature within 15 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 21 Dexterity
saving throw or take 15 (2d6 + 8) bludgeoning damage and be knocked
prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.
