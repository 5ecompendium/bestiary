***Locus of Spirits.*** Whenever a non-evil humanoid dies
within 60 feet of the wraith, their body rises as an
Overgrowth Ghoul under the wraithâ€™s control 1d4
rounds later.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The wraith uses its Convert Flesh ability.
It then makes two vine slash attacks..

***Vine Slash.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach
10 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 2) slashing damage.

***Convert Flesh.*** Target creature within 60 feet makes
a DC 13 Constitution saving throw against being
magically petrified. On a failed save, the creature
begins to turn to wood and their movement speed
is reduced to 0 ft. It must repeat the saving throw
at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect
ends. On a failure, the creature turns to wood and is
considered petrified for 24 hours.

***Rain of Splinters (Recharge 5-6).*** The wraith
unleashes an explosion of sharp splinters in a 15
foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a
DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 27 (6d8)
piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much
on a successful one.
