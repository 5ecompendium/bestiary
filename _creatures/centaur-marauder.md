***Specialized Combatant.*** The centaur is considered
mounted for the purposes of using a lance in
combat.

***Impaling Strike.*** If the centaur moves at least 30 feet
straight toward a target and then hits it with a lance
attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra
10 (3d6) piercing damage and must succeed on a
DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or become impaled
by the centaurâ€™s lance. While impaled, the creature
is considered grappled (escape DC 12) and takes an
additional 10 (3d6) piercing damage at the end of
each of its turns. While a creature is impaled, the
centaur may not attack with its lance or longbow
unless it chooses to end this effect.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The centaur makes two attacks: one
with its lance and one with its hooves or two with
its greatbow.

***Lance.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft.,
one target. Hit: 11 (1d12 + 5) piercing damage.

***Hooves.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5ft.,
one target. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage.

***Greatbow.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range
150/600 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d8 + 2) piercing
damage.
