***Eye Beams.*** When a blindheim’s eyes are open, it emits a 30-
foot cone of light. It can see normally in this light and functions
normally in areas of magical darkness. A creature looking at a
blindheim when its eye beams are “on” must succeed on a DC
12 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 hour. A blinded
creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns,
ending the effect on a success.

### Actions

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage.
