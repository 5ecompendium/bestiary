***Special Equipment.*** Azbara has two scrolls of mage armor.

***Potent Cantrips.*** When Azbara casts an evocation Cantrips and misses, or the target succeeds on its saving throw, the target still takes half the cantrip's damage but suffers no other effect.

***Sculpt Spells.*** When Azbara casts an evocation spell that affects other creatures that he can see, he can choose a number of them equal to 1+the spell's level to succeed on their saving throws against the spell. Those creatures take no damage if they would normally take half damage from the spell.

* Cantrips (at will): <i>mage hand, prestidigitation, ray of frost, shocking grasp</i>

* 1st level (4 slots): <i>fog cloud, magic missile, shield, thunderwave</i>

* 2nd level (3 slots): <i>invisibility, misty step, scorching ray</i>

* 3rd level (3 slots): <i>counterspell, dispel magic, fireball</i>

### Actions
