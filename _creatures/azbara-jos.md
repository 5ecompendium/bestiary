***Special Equipment.*** Azbara has two scrolls of mage armor.

***Potent Cantrips.*** When Azbara casts an evocation Cantrips and misses, or the target succeeds on its saving throw, the target still takes half the cantrip's damage but suffers no other effect.

***Sculpt Spells.*** When Azbara casts an evocation spell that affects other creatures that he can see, he can choose a number of them equal to 1+the spell's level to succeed on their saving throws against the spell. Those creatures take no damage if they would normally take half damage from the spell.

***Spellcasting.*** Azbara is a 6th-level spellcaster that uses Intelligence as his spellcasting ability (spell save DC 13, +5 to hit with spell attacks). Azbara has the following spells prepared from the wizard spell list:

* Cantrips (at will): mage hand, prestidigitation, ray of frost, shocking grasp

* 1st level (4 slots): fog cloud, magic missile, shield, thunderwave

* 2nd level (3 slots): invisibility, misty step, scorching ray

* 3rd level (3 slots): counterspell, dispel magic, fireball

### Actions

***Dagger.*** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or ranged 20 ft./60 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage.
