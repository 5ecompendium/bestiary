***Fiery Heart.*** A tophet's inner fire can be ignited or doused at will. Its heat is such that all creatures have resistance to cold damage while within 30 feet of the tophet.

***Burning Belly.*** Creatures inside a tophet's burning core take 21 (6d6) fire damage at the start of each of the tophet's turns. Escaping from a tophet's belly takes 10 feet of movement and a successful DC 16 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** A tophet makes two attacks, no more than one of which can be a gout of flame.

***Slam.*** Melee Weapon Attack. +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

***Hit: 12 (1d10 + 7) bludgeoning damage.*** The target is also knocked inside the tophet's burning belly if the attack scores a critical hit.

***Gout of Flame.*** The tophet targets a point within 100 feet of itself that it can see. All targets within 10 feet of that point take 22 (4d10) fire damage, or half damage with a successful DC 16 Dexterity saving throw.
