***Dragon Fanatic.*** The dragonfang has advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened. While the dragonfang can see a dragon or higher-ranking Cult of the Dragon cultist friendly to it, the dragonfang ignores the effects of being charmed or frightened.

***Fanatic Advantage.*** Once per turn, if the dragonfang makes a weapon attack with advantage on the attack roll and hits, the target takes an extra 10 (3d6) damage.

***Limited Flight.*** The dragonfang can use a bonus action to gain a flying speed of 30 feet until the end of its turn.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The Dragonfang attacks twice with its shortsword.

***Shortsword.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) damage of the type to which the dragonfang has resistance.

***Orb of Dragon's Breath (2/Day).*** Ranged Spell Attack: +5 to hit, range 50 ft., one target. Hit: 22 (5d8) damage of the type to which the dragonfang has damage resistance.
