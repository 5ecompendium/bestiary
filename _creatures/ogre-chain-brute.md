### Actions

***Fist*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach ft., one target. Hit: 9 (2d4 + 4) bludgeoning damage.

***Chain Sweep*** The ogre swings its chain, and every creature within 10 feet of it must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed saving throw, a creature takes 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone.

***Chain Smash (Recharge 6)*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage, and the target must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failure the target is unconscious for 1 minute. The unconscious target repeats the saving throw if it takes damage and at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
