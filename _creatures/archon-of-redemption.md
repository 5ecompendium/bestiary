***Angelic Weapons.*** The archon’s weapon attacks are magical. When the
archon hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 3d8 radiant
damage (included in the attack).

***Axiomatic Mind.*** The archon can’t be compelled to act in a manner
contrary to its nature or its understanding of justice.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The archon’s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma
(spell save DC 17). The archon can innately cast the following spells,
requiring only verbal components:

* At will: <i>detect evil and good</i>

* 1/day each: <i>destructive wave, geas</i>

***Magic Resistance.*** The archon has advantage on saving throws against
spells and other magical effects.

***One Being.*** Though it appears as a humanoid creature riding a mount,
an archon is a single being. The “rider” can’t be dismounted, and no
other means can separate the two portions of the archon’s being short
of its death.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The archon makes two attacks: one with its sword and
one with its claws.

***Sword.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8
(1d8 + 4) slashing damage plus 13 (3d8) radiant damage.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 11
(2d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 13 (3d8) radiant damage.
