***Echolocation.*** The whale can’t use its blindsight while deafened.

***Hold Breath.*** The whale can hold its breath for 30 minutes.

***Keen Hearing.*** The whale has advantage on Wisdom (Perception)
checks that rely on hearing.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The fire whale makes two attacks: one with its bite and
one with its tail slap.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 34
(7d6 + 10) piercing damage.

***Tail Slap.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target.
Hit: 23 (2d12 + 10) bludgeoning damage.

***Scalding Blast (Recharge 5–6).*** A fire whale can release a blast of
superheated air in a 60-foot cone from its blowhole that scalds or burns
those contacting it. Each creature in that area must make a DC 16 Dexterity
saving throw, taking 49 (14d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as
much on a successful one.
