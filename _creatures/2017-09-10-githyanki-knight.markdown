***Innate Spellcasting (Psionics).*** The githyanki's innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 13, +5 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no components: 

At will: mage hand (the hand is invisible)

3/day each: jump, misty step, nondetection (self only), tongues

1/day each: plane shift, telekinesis

**Actions**

***Multiattack.*** The githyanki makes two silver greatsword attacks.

***Silver Greatsword.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d6 + 6) slashing damage plus 10 (3d6) psychic damage. This is a magic weapon attack. On a critical hit against a target in an astral body (as with the astral projection spell), the githyanki can cut the silvery cord that tethers the target to its material body, instead of dealing damage.
