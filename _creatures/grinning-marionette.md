***Bound Servitude.*** All marionettes serve a Grim
Puppeteer. This master can use its action to see
through the marionetteâ€™s eyes and the marionette can
communicate with its master from anywhere. The
marionette is forced to execute the orders of its master
to the best of its abilities. The marionette becomes a
mundane doll if its master is killed.

***False Appearance.*** While the marionette remains
motionless, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary doll.

### Actions

***Draining Touch.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach
5ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) bludgeoning damage
and the target must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution
saving throw or take an additional 2 (1d4) necrotic
damage.
