***Undead Fortitude.*** If damage reduces the zombie to 0
hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw
with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage
is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the
zombie drops to 1 hit point instead.


### Actions

***Greatsword.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5ft.,
one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage.

***Spew Bile (recharge 5-6).*** The zombie spews bile in 15-
foot line. Each creature in that line must make a DC 12
Constitution saving throw, taking 17 (5d6) necrotic
damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one.
