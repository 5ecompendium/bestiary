***Lightning.*** A creature that touches the lightning elemental or hits it with
a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 7 (2d6) lightning damage.

***Water Susceptibility.*** For every 5 feet that the lightning elemental
moves in water, or for every gallon of water splashed on it, it takes 1 cold
damage.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The lightning elemental makes two slam attacks.

***Slam.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) lightning damage.

***Lightning Bolt.*** Ranged Spell Attack: +6 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 22 (4d8 + 4) lightning damage.

***Globe Lightning (1/Long Rest).*** The lightning elemental
discharges 3 globes of electricity that hover in its space for 1 minute.
Whenever a creature enters or starts its turn within 5 feet of the
elemental, one of the globes discharges. The target must make a DC 14
Dexterity saving throw, taking 7 (1d6 + 4) lightning damage on a failed
saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one. As each globe
discharges, it disappears.
