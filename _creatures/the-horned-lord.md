***Turn Resistance.*** The Horned Lord has advantage on saving throws

against spells and other magical effects.

***Regeneration.*** The Horned Lord regains 1d6 hit points at the beginning

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The Horned Lord makes three attacks with Harrowblade.

***Harrowblade.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
Hit: 12 (2d6+5) slashing damage plus 14 (4d6) cold damage. On a natural
19 or 20 attack roll, living creatures must make a DC 20 Wisdom saving
throw, taking 14 (4d6) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much
damage on a successful one.

***Dominate (Recharge 5–6).*** The Horned Lord speaks in a commanding
voice, calling on all to bow down to him. Each creature within 60 feet
of the Horned Lord must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or
be incapacitated for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at
the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. If a creature’s
saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune
to the Horned Lord’s Dominate for the next 24 hours.

### Legendary Actions

The Horned Lord can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the
options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only
at the end of another creature’s turn. The Horned Lord regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

***Cantrip.*** The Horned Lord casts a cantrip.

***Spell (Costs 2 Actions).*** The Horned Lord casts a prepared spell.

***Stunning Wave (Costs 2 Actions).*** The Horned Lord unleashes a pulse
of overwhelming evil energy. Each living creature within 20 feet of the
Horned Lord must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or be stunned
until the end of the Horned Lord’s next turn.

***Death Gaze (Costs 3 Actions).*** The Horned Lord chooses one creature
within 60 feet of it that it can see. The creature must make a DC 18
Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature drops to 0 hit points.
On a success, a creature takes 21 (6d6) psychic damage.

### Lair Actions

The Horned Lord instinctively makes his lair in a dark fortress, located
in the heart of a wasteland far from civilization, and here, he marshals
his evil forces, summons nightmarish demons, and performs unspeakable
sacrifices. Guarded by hordes of evil humanoids and fiends, the Horned
Lord can also perform several unique acts to help defend himself against
those who dare to challenge him in his lair.

On Initiative 20 (losing initiative ties), the Horned Lord takes a lair
action to cause one of the following effects. The Horned Lord can’t use
the same effect two rounds in a row.

***Miasmal Cloud.*** A dark miasma permeates the area in a 90-foot radius
from the Horned Lord. All living creatures in the area must make a DC 20
Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of Horned Lord’s
next turn.

***Shades.*** The Horned Lord summons memories and shades from one
living creature’s past. The creature must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving
throw or take 36 (8d8) psychic damage and gain a level of exhaustion.

***Wall of Arms.*** The Horned Lord can make the ghostly limbs of past
victims manifest in the air around foes in a 60-foot radius centered on him.
Each creature in this area must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or
be restrained until the end of the Horned Lord’s next turn.

### Regional Effects

The region around the Horned Lord’s lair is warped by his magic,
creating one or more of the following effects:

***Hot Lava.*** Fissures and magma eruptions spread across the area,
destroying structures and causing 11 (2d10) fire damage per turn to
anyone who falls into one.

***Dark and Stormy.*** The sky grows gloomy and clouded, causing dim
light conditions and occasionally lightly obscured patches of smoke and
dark fog.

***Sulfurous Gas.*** Vents of sulfurous gas release poison into the
atmosphere. Anyone encountering such a vent must make a DC 12
Constitution saving throw or take 13 (3d8) poison damage and be poisoned
for 1d6 hours.

If the Horned Lord dies, conditions surrounding the lair return to normal
over the course of 1d10 days.

# Harrowblade

<i>Weapon (scythe), artifact (requires attunement)</i>

This perpetually bloody weapon is a crooked scythe, a farming
implement. It appears truly ancient, the blade filthy with ichor
and long rust-covered. It stands 7 feet tall and exudes menace;
it awakens a primal fear within all living creatures, causing their
bowels to loosen in terror.

***Unholy Aura.*** Living creatures cannot take long rests within 300
feet of Harrowblade. In addition, within 10 feet of Harrowblade,
all holy water is destroyed, and creatures of CR 0 and plants that
are not creatures die.

***Magic Weapon.*** Harrowblade is a heavy, two-handed weapon
that deals 2d6 slashing damage plus 4d6 cold damage on a hit, and
you have a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with the
weapon. You score a critical hit if you roll a natural 19 or 20 on
the attack roll with the weapon, and any living creature struck by
the critical hit must make a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw, taking an
additional 4d6 psychic damage on a failed saving throw, or half as
much damage on a successful saving throw. Finally, Harrowblade
also functions as a mace of terror, save that it has 7 charges and
regains them at midnight.

***Blessings of the Dead.*** You have a +1 bonus to your Armor
Class while you wield Harrowblade, and have resistance to radiant
damage. In addition, at the beginning of each of your turns, you
regain 1d6 hit points if you have at least 1 hit point remaining.

***Sentience.*** Harrowblade is a lawful evil magic weapon. It has
hearing and vision to a distance of 120 feet and understands all
the languages you do. It can communicate with emotions alone.
It has an Intelligence of 10, a Wisdom of 14, and a Charisma of
16. Harrowblade’s purpose is to enslave all living creatures and
enthrone its wielder atop the new empire of tyranny it has helped
create. It will rebel against a wielder whom it believes is not strong
enough to carry out such a task.

***Destruction.*** Harrowblade can be destroyed by a group of 7
lawful good clerics immersing Harrowblade into a bath of holy
water, then each casting holy aura on the weapon. The combined
might of these blessings is enough to shatter the blade of the magic
weapon into fragments, leaving it nascent...until the Horned Lord
rises again.
