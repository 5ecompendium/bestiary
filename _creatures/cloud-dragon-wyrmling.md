***Windborn.*** The dragon cannot be moved or knocked prone by
magical or nonmagical winds of any kind.

### Actions

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7
(1d10 + 2) piercing damage plus 3 (1d6) cold damage.

***Breath Weapons (Recharge 5â€“6).*** The dragon uses one of the following
breath weapons.

* <i>Cloud Breath.</i> The dragon exhales an icy blast in a
15-foot cone that spreads around corners. Each creature in that area must
make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 22 (5d8) cold damage on
a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one.

* <i>Wind Breath.</i> The dragon exhales gale-force winds in a 20-foot line that
is 10-feet wide. Creatures in this area must make a DC 11 Strength saving
throw, taking 18 (4d8) bludgeoning damage on a failed saving throw and
are pushed 20 feet directly away from the dragon. On a successful saving
throw, the creature takes half damage and is not pushed. A creature who
is pushed and strikes a solid surface takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage per
10 feet traveled. Nonmagical flames are completely extinguished, and
magical flames created by a spell of 2nd level or lower are immediately
dispelled.
