***Incorporeal Movement.*** The corpse candle can move through other
creatures and objects in a body of water as if they were difficult terrain. It
takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object or outside
its body of water.

***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** While in sunlight, the corpse candle has
disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks
that rely on sight.

### Actions

***Watery Touch.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach ft., one target.
Hit: 9 (2d6 + 2) necrotic damage, and the target’s Strength score is
reduced by 1d4. The target dies if this reduces its Strength to 0.
Otherwise, the reduction lasts until the target finishes a short or long
rest.
A humanoid slain by this attack rises 24 hours later as a zombie
unless the humanoid is restored to life or its body is destroyed.

***Hypnotic Lights.*** The corpse candle creates a twisting,
dancing pattern of ever-shifting colored lights in a 10-foot cube
at a point it can see within 60 feet of itself. The pattern appears
for a minute then vanishes. Each creature in the area who sees
the pattern must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw.
On a failed save, the creature becomes charmed for 1 minute.
While charmed, the creature is incapacitated and has a speed
of 0. When a charmed creature takes damage it can repeat the
saving throw, ending the effect on a success.
A creature that starts its turn within the 10-foot cube of lights
must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or the target’s
Constitution score is reduced by 1d4. The target dies if this reduces
its Constitution to 0. Otherwise, the reduction lasts until the target
finishes a short or long rest.
