***Death Burst.*** When the mephit dies, it explodes in a cloud of smoke.
Each creature within 5 feet of the mephit must make a successful DC 10
Constitution saving throw or take 1d4 fire damage and be poisoned for 1
minute. A poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each
of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The mephit can innately cast <i>blur</i> 1/day, requiring
no material components. Its innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell
save DC 12, +4 to hit with spell attacks).

### Actions

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 4
(1d4 + 2) slashing damage plus 2 (1d4) fire damage.

***Sooty Breath (Recharge 5â€“6).*** The mephit exhales black soot in a 15-
foot cone. All creatures within that area must make a DC 12 Dexterity
saving throw, taking 9 (2d8) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much
damage on a successful one.

***Ember Storm (1/day).*** A soot mephit can create a downpour of whitehot
embers that affects a 20-foot radius sphere centered on itself. All
creatures caught in the storm must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw,
taking 10 (3d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on
a successful one.
