***Vital Strikes.*** When the hunter hits a creature with a
weapon attack, the creature takes an extra 4 (1d8)
damage if it is below its hit point maximum.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The hunter makes two attacks with its
shortsword or two with its longbow.

***Shortsword.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach
5ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage.

***Longbow.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, range
150/600 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing
damage.

***Rain of Arrows (Recharge 5-6).*** The hunter fires a
magical arrow at a point within 150 feet. When the
arrow reaches its destination, it explodes into
hundreds of individual arrows that rain down and
coat the battlefield in a 30 foot cone directly
beneath the initial arrow’s location. Each creature in
this area must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving
throw, taking 27 (6d8) piercing damage on a failed
save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Hunt Them Down (1/Day).*** All creatures within 300
feet of the hunter come under the effects of the
<i>hunter’s mark</i> spell for the next 24 hours. After the
hunter uses this ability, it makes a longbow attack
against each enemy it can see within 150 feet,
making a separate attack roll for each attack.

### Bonus Actions

***One With Nature.*** While outdoors, the hunter can
take the Hide action as a bonus action on each of
its turns.

***Strike From The Shadows.*** When the hunter starts its
turn with no one aware of its presence, if the
hunter takes the Attack action this turn it may make
one additional attack with its longbow or
shortsword as a bonus action.
