***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The dragon's innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 18, +10 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

At will: tongues

5/day each: dispel magic, enhance ability

***Spellcasting.*** The dragon is a 6th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 18, +10 to hit with spell attacks). It requires no material components to cast its spells. The dragon has the following wizard spells prepared:

Cantrips (at will): acid splash, light, mage hand, prestidigitation

1st level (4 slots): charm person, expeditious retreat, magic missile, unseen servant

2nd level (3 slots): blur, hold person, see invisibility

3rd level (3 slots): haste, lightning bolt, protection from energy

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (2d10 + 8) piercing damage.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d6 +8) slashing damage, and the target loses 4 hit points from bleeding at the start of each of its turns for six rounds unless it receives magical healing. Bleeding damage is cumulative; the target loses 4 hp per round for each bleeding wound it's taken from a mithral dragon's claws.

***Tail.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (2d8 + 8) bludgeoning damage.

***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

***Breath Weapon (Recharge 5-6).*** A mithral dragon can spit a 60-foot-long, 5-foot-wide line of metallic shards. Targets in its path take 42 (12d6) magical slashing damage and lose another 8 hit points from bleeding at the start of their turns for 6 rounds; slashing and bleed damage are halved by a successful DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. Only magical healing stops the bleeding before 6 rounds. The shards dissolve into wisps of smoke 1 round after the breath weapon's use.

### Legendary Actions

***The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below.*** Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

***Detect.*** The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.

***Tail Attack.*** The dragon makes a tail attack.

***Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).*** The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 10 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw or take 15 (2d6 + 8) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.
