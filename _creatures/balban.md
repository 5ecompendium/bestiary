***Magic Resistance.*** The demon has advantage on saving throws against
spells and other magical effects.

***Magic Weapons.*** The demon’s weapon attacks are magical.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The demon’s spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell
save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks). The demon can innately cast the
following spells, requiring no material components: 

* At will: <i>fear, darkness, dispel magic, teleport, see invisibility</i>

***Charge.*** If the demon moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature
and then hits it with a bite attack on the same turn, that target must
succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the
target is prone, the demon can make one slam attack against it as a
bonus action.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The demon can use its smash, make one bite attack
and two claw attacks.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit:
16 (2d8 + 7) piercing damage.

***Slam.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit:
17 (3d6 + 7) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller
creature, it is grappled (escape DC 17). Until this grapple ends, the target
is restrained and the demon cannot use this attack against another target.

***Smash.*** One Medium or smaller creature grappled by the demon is
smashed into nearby solid objects or a solid surface. The target takes 25
(4d8 + 7) bludgeoning damage and must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution
saving throw or be stunned until the end of its next turn.
