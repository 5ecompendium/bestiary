***Aggressive.*** As a bonus action, the zombie can move up to its speed toward a hostile creature that it can see.

***Undead fortitude.*** If damage reduces the zombie to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the zombie drops to 1 hit point instead.
