***Disruptive.*** Because of the qwyllion's nauseating nature, spellcasters have disadvantage on concentration checks while within 40 feet of the qwyllion.

***Nauseating Aura.*** The qwyllion is nauseatingly corrupt. Any creature that starts its turn within 20 feet of the qwyllion must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1d8 rounds. If a creature that's already poisoned by this effect fails the saving throw again, it becomes incapacitated instead, and a creature already incapacitated by the qwyllion drops to 0 hit points if it fails the saving throw. A successful saving throw renders a creature immune to the effect for 24 hours. Creatures dominated by the qwyllion are immune to this effect.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The qwyllion uses its deadly gaze if it can, and makes two claw attacks.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 24 (3d12 + 5) slashing damage.

***Deadly Gaze (recharge 5-6).*** The qwyllion turns its gaze against a single creature within 20 feet of the qwyllion. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take 16 (3d8 + 3) necrotic damage and be incapacitated until the start of the qwyllion's next turn. A humanoid slain by a qwyllion's death gaze rises 2d4 hours later as a specter under the qwyllion's control.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The qwyllion's innate casting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14). She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

3/day each: dominate person (range 20 feet), shatter
