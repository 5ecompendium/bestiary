***Corrupting Touch.*** A herald of darkness can destroy any wooden, leather, copper, iron, or paper object by touching it as a bonus action. A mundane item is destroyed automatically; a magical item survives if its owner makes a successful DC 16 Dexterity saving throw.

***Gift of Darkness.*** A herald of darkness can transform any fey, human, or goblin into one of the shadow fey, if the target willingly accepts this transformation.

***Shadow Form.*** A herald of darkness can become incorporeal as a shadow as a bonus action. In this form, it has a fly speed of 10 feet; it can enter and occupy spaces occupied by other creatures; it gains resistance to all nonmagical damage; it has advantage on physical saving throws; it can pass through any gap or opening; it can't attack, interact with physical objects, or speak. It can return to its corporeal form also as a bonus action.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The herald of darkness uses Majesty of the Abyss, if it is available, and makes one melee attack.

***Embrace Darkness.*** Melee Weapon Attack. +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., all creatures in reach. Hit: 6 (1d12) necrotic damage and targets are paralyzed until the start of the herald's next turn. Making a DC 17 Constitution saving throw negates the paralysis.

***Majesty of the Abyss (Recharge 4-6).*** The herald of darkness emits a sinister burst of infernal power. All creatures within 30 feet and in direct line of sight of the herald take 19 (3d12) necrotic damage and must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. Those who fail the saving throw are blinded for 2 rounds; those who succeed are frightened for 2 rounds.

***Shadow Sword.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (2d12 + 5) slashing damage.
