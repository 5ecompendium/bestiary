***Frozen Flesh.*** A creature that touches the alchemist
or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of
it takes 4 (1d8) cold damage.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The alchemist makes two freezing
strike attacks.

***Freezing Strike.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit,
reach 5ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) bludgeoning
damage plus 5 (2d4) cold damage and the target's
movement speed is reduced by 10 on its next turn.
If the alchemist hits the same target with both of
its freezing strike attacks in a single round, the
target is restrained until the end of their next turn
instead.
