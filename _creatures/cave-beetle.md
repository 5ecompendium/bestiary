***Death Throes.*** When a giant cave beetle reaches 0 hit points, it releases
a strong acidic cloud in a 5-foot radius. Creatures within this area must
make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 7 (2d6) acid damage on a
failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful saving throw.
Every giant cave beetle in 500 feet is capable of detecting the smell of
this acid.

### Actions

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d8 + 2)
slashing damage.
