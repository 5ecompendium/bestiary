***Tactical Insight.*** The city watch captain has advantage on initiative rolls. City watch soldiers under the captain's command take their turns on the same initiative count as the captain.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The city watch captain makes two rapier attacks and one dagger attack. The captain can substitute a disarming attack for one rapier attack.

***Rapier.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft, one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage.

***Dagger.*** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage.

***Light Crossbow.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage.

***Disarming Attack.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: the target must make a successful DC 13 Strength saving throw or drop one item it's holding of the city watch captain's choice. The item lands up to 10 feet from the target, in a spot selected by the captain.

***Orders to Attack (1/Day).*** Each creature of the city watch captain's choice that is within 30 feet of it and can hear it makes one melee or ranged weapon attack as a reaction. This person could easily have been on the other side of the law, but he likes the way he looks in the city watch uniform.and the way city residents look at him when he walks down the street leading a patrol. With a long mustache and a jaunty cap, there's no denying that he cuts a rakishly handsome figure. While a trained investigator, the city watch captain is not afraid to draw his blade to end a threat to his city.
