***Undead Fortitude.*** If damage reduces the zombie to 0 hit points, it
makes a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5+ the damage taken,
unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the
zombie drops to 1 hit point instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** The vrock has advantage on saving throws against
spells and other magical effects.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The vrock makes two attacks: one with its beak and one
with its talons.

***Beak.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10
(2d6 + 3) piercing damage.

***Talons.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14
(2d10 + 3) slashing damage.

***Spores (Recharge 6).*** A 15-foot radius cloud of toxic spores extends
out from the vrock. The spores spread around corners. Each creature in
that area must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become
poisoned. While poisoned in this way, a target takes 5 (1d10) poison
damage at the start of each of its turns. A target can repeat the saving throw
at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
Emptying a vial of holy water on the target also ends the effect on it.

***Stunning Screech (1/day).*** The vrock emits a horrific screech. Each
creature within 20 feet of it that can hear it and that isn’t a demon must
succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end
of the vrock’s next turn.
