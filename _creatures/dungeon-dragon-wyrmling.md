***Innate Spellcasting.*** The dungeon dragon’s innate spellcasting ability
is Charisma (spell save DC 12, +4 to hit with spell attacks). It can cast
the following spells, requiring no material components.

* At will: <i>alarm, arcane lock, detect magic, identify, knock</i>

* 1/day each: <i>find traps, scrying, stone shape, wall of stone</i>

***Labyrinthine Recall.*** The dungeon dragon can perfectly recall any path
it has traveled.

***Trap Master.*** The dungeon dragon has advantage on saving throws
against the effects of traps.

### Actions

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9
(1d10 + 4) piercing damage.

***Confusion Breath (Recharge 5–6).*** The dragon exhales gas in a
15-foot cone that spreads around corners. Each creature in that area
must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save,
the creature is confused for 1 minute. While confused, the creature
uses its action to Dash in a random direction, even if that movement
takes the creature into dangerous areas. A confused creature can
repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the
effect on a success.
