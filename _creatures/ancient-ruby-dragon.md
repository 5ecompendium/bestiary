a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

feet have their saving throw DC increased by 4.

### Psionics

***Charges:*** 26 | ***Recharge:*** 1d10 | ***Fracture:*** 32

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The dragon makes three attacks: one
with its bite and two with its claws.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 15 ft.,
one target. Hit: 17 (2d10 + 6) piercing damage.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 10 ft.,

### Legendary Actions

The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing
from the options below. Only one legendary action
option can be used at a time and only at the end of
another creature’s turn. The dragon regains spent
legendary actions at the start of its turn.

***Detect.*** The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) Check.

***Psionics.*** The dragon uses a psionic ability.

***Psionic Shift (Costs 2 Actions).*** The dragon
releases a wave of telekinetic energy from its mind.
Every creature within 15 feet must make a DC 24
Intelligence saving throw or take 15 (2d6 + 8) force
damage and be knocked prone. The dragon then
can move up to half its movement speed.

### Lair Actions

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the
dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the
following effects. The dragon can’t use the same
effect two rounds in a row.

* The dragon manifests <i>amplify</i> at no cost.

* The dragon manifests <i>the real</i> at no cost. It
does not require concentration and lasts for
10 minutes.

* The dragon casts <i>dispel magic</i>. The spell automatically
ends spells of 5th level or lower. For
each spell of 6th level or higher on the target,
make an ability check using the dragon’s
Intelligence as its spellcasting ability. The DC
equals 10 + the spell’s leveI. On a successful
check, the spell ends.

### Regional Effects

Intelligent creatures who sleep within 12 miles of
a ruby dragon’s lair dream of people they know
transforming into other people, of places they’ve
been dissolving to reveal barren wastelands.
