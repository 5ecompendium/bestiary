***Innate Spellcasting.*** The stormwarden’s spellcasting ability is
Intelligence (spell save DC 13, + 5 to hit with spell attacks). The
stormwarden can innately cast the following spells, requiring only verbal
components:

* At will: <i>thaumaturgy</i>

* 1/day: <i>fog cloud</i>

### Actions

***Longsword.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
Hit: 6 (1d8 + 2) slashing damage, or 7 (1d10 + 2) slashing damage if used
with two hands.

***Longbow.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +2 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one
target. Hit: 4 (1d8) piercing damage.

***Stormscream (1/day).*** The stormwarden unleashes a deafening scream
filled with the fury of the storm in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that
area must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a
creature takes 9 (2d8) thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from
the stormwarden. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much
damage and isn’t pushed.
