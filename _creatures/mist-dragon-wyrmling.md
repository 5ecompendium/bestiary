***Amphibious.*** The mist dragon can breathe both water and air.

### Actions

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9
(1d10 + 4) piercing damage plus 3 (1d6) fire damage.

***Breath Weapon (Recharge 5–6).*** The mist dragon uses one of the
following breath weapons.

1. <i>Obscuring Mist.</i> The dragon exhales a murky opaque mist in a 15-foot
cube that spreads around corners. This mist heavily obscures the area and
remains for 1 minute, or until dispersed with a moderate or stronger wind
(at least 10 miles per hour).

2. <i>Scalding Mist.</i> The dragon exhales a fiery blast of lingering mist in a 15-
foot cone that spreads around corners. The mist lightly obscures the area
and remains for 1 minute, or until dispersed with a moderate or stronger
wind (at least 10 miles per hour). Each creature that enters the area or
begins their turn there must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw,
taking 24 (7d6) fire damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much
damage on a successful one. Being underwater doesn’t grant resistance
to this damage.
