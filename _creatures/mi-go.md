***Astral Travelers.*** Mi-go do not require air or heat to survive, only sunlight (and very little of that). They can enter a sporulated form capable of surviving travel through the void and returning to consciousness when conditions are right.

***Sneak Attack (1/Turn).*** The mi-go does an extra 7 (2d6) damage when it hits a target with a claw attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of the mi-go that isn't incapacitated and the mi-go doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

***Disquieting Technology.*** The mi-go are a highly advanced race, and may carry items of powerful technology. Mi-go technology can be represented using the same rules as magic items, but their functions are very difficult to determine: identify is useless, but an hour of study and a successful DC 19 Arcana check can reveal the purpose and proper functioning of a mi.go item.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The mi-go makes two attacks with its claws.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (3d6 + 4) slashing damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 13). If both claw attacks strike the same target in a single turn, the target takes an additional 13 (2d12) psychic damage.

### Reactions

***Spore Release.*** When a mi-go dies, it releases its remaining spores. All living creatures within 10 feet take 14 (2d8 + 5) poison damage and become poisoned; a successful DC 16 Constitution saving throw halves the damage and prevents poisoning. A poisoned creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effect on itself with a success.
