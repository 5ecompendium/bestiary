***Magic Resistance.*** The oaken bolter has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Actions

***Multiattack*** The oaken bolter makes two lancing bolt attacks or one lancing bolt attack and one harpoon attack.

***Lancing Bolt*** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 100/400 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d10 + 4) piercing damage.

***Harpoon*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, range 50/200 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d10 + 4) piercing damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 12). While grappled in this way, a creature's speed isn't reduced, but it can move only in directions that bring it closer to the oaken bolter. A creature takes 5 (1d10) slashing damage if it escapes from the grapple or if it tries and fails. As a bonus action, the oaken bolter can pull a creature grappled by it 20 feet closer. The oaken bolter can grapple only one creature at a time.

***Explosive Bolt (Recharge 5-6)*** The oaken bolter launches an explosive charge at a point within 120 feet. Each creature within 20 feet of that point must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 17 (5d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
