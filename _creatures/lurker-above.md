***Damage Transfer.*** While it is grappling a creature, the lurker above
takes only half the damage dealt to it, and the creature grappled by the
lurker above takes the other half.

***Keen Scent.*** The lurker above has advantage on Wisdom (Perception)
checks based on scent.

***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** While in sunlight, the lurker above has
disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks
that rely on sight.

### Actions

***Slam.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 17
(3d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage and the target is grappled (escape DC 15)
and the lurker above cannot grapple or use its Slam attack on another
target.

***Smother.*** The lurker above wraps itself around one grappled creature
of Large size or smaller, completely enclosing it. The grappled target
is restrained, blinded, no longer able to speak or use spells with verbal
components, and at risk of suffocating. At the start of each of the targetâ€™s
turns, the target takes 17 (3d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.
