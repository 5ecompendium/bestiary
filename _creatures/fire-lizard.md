***Rampage.*** When the fire lizard reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a
melee attack on its turn, the fire lizard can take a bonus action to move up
to half its speed and make a bite attack.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The fire lizard makes three attacks: one with its bite and
two with its claws.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 16
(2d8 + 7) piercing damage.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 21
(4d6 +7) slashing damage.

***Fire Breath (Recharge 5â€“6).*** The fire lizard exhales a blast of fire in
a 20-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 16 Dexterity
savings throw, taking 28 (8d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as
much on a successful one.
