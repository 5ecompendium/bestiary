***Death Burst.*** When the mephit dies, it explodes in a
burst of lava. Each creature within 5 feet of it must
make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14
(4d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much
damage on a successful one.

***False Appearance.*** While the mephit remains
motionless, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary
mound of magma.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The mephit makes two claw attacks.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5ft.,
one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage plus 5
(2d4) fire damage.

***Magma Spout (Recharge 6).*** The mephit causes
magma to burst forward from a point on a solid
surface within 50 ft. All creatures a 15-foot line in
front of that point must make a DC 12 dexterity
saving throw, taking 13 (3d8) fire damage on a
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful
one.
