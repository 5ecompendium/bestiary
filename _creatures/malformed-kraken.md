***Amphibious.*** The kraken can breathe air and water.

***Siege Monster.*** The kraken deals double damage to objects and structures.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The kraken makes three tentacle attacks. One of them can be replaced with a bite attack, and any of them can be replaced with Fling.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d8 + 7) piercing damage.

***Tentacle.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d6 + 7) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 16). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained. The kraken has ten tentacles, each of which can grapple one target.

***Fling.*** One Medium or smaller object held or creature grappled by the kraken's tentacles is thrown up to 60 feet in a random direction and knocked prone. If a thrown target strikes a solid surface, the target takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked prone.

***Lightning Storm.*** The kraken creates three bolts of lightning, each of which can strike a target the kraken can see within 150 feet ofit. A target must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 16 (3d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
