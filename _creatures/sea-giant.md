***Amphibious.*** The sea giant can breathe air and water.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The giant’s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma
(spell save DC 16, +8 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the
following spells, requiring no material components:

* At will: <i>create or destroy water, detect magic</i>

* 5/day: <i>control water</i>

* 3/day: <i>control weather</i>

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The sea giant makes two slam attacks.

***Slam.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (2d8 + 9) bludgeoning damage.

***Rock.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target.
Hit: 27 (4d8 + 9) bludgeoning damage.

***Crushing Pressure (Recharge 5–6).*** The sea giant chooses an area of
water no larger than a 50-foot cube with 30 ft. of it. The water pressure
within the space magically increases, and creatures within the area treat
it as difficult terrain. In addition, any creature who enters or begins its
turn within the area must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking
18 (4d8) bludgeoning damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much
damage on a successful one. The area remains affected by this magic for
1 minute, until the sea giant dismisses it as an action, or the sea giant dies.
