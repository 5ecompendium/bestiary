***Axiomatic Mind.*** The pentadrone can't be compelled to act in a manner contrary to its nature or its instructions.

***Disintegration.*** If the pentadrone dies, its body disintegrates into dust, leaving behind its weapons and anything else it was carrying.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The pentadrone makes five arm attacks.

***Arm.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage.

***Paralysis Gas (Recharge 5-6).*** The pentadrone exhales a 30-foot cone of gas. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
