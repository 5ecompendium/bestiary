At will: animal friendship (snakes only)

***Magic Resistance.*** The yuan-ti has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Mind Fangs (2/Day).*** The first time the yuan-ti hits with a melee attack on its turn, it can deal an extra 16 (3d10) psychic damage to the target.

***Spellcasting (Yuan-ti Form Only).*** The yuan-ti is a 6th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 13, +5 to hit with spell attacks). It regains its expended spell slots when it finishes a short or long rest. It knows the following warlock spells:

Cantrips (at will): eldritch blast (range 300 ft., +3 bonus to each damage roll),friends, message, minor illusion, poison spray, prestidigitation

1st-3rd level (2 3rd-level slots): charm person, crown of madness, detect thoughts, expeditious retreat, fly, hypnotic pattern, illusory script

***Variant: Chameleon Skin.*** The yuan-ti has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide.

***Variant: Shed Skin (1/Day).*** The yuan-ti can shed its skin as a bonus action to free itself from a grapple, shackles, or other restraints. If the yuan-ti spends 1 minute eating its shed skin, it regains hit points equal to half its hit point maximum.
