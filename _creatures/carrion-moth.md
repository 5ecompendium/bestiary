***Death Throes.*** When the carrion moth reaches 0 hit points, it splits
open and a gas spews forth in a 10-foot radius. All creatures in the area
except for other carrion moths must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution
saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. A poisoned creature can
repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect
on a success.

***Drone.*** A creature who begins its turn within 60 feet of the carrion moth
must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be incapacitated until
the beginning of its next turn. If a creature succeeds on the saving throw,
or the condition ends on it, it is immune to the moth’s drone for 24 hours.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The carrion moth makes one bite attack and two tentacles
attacks.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage.

***Tentacles.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit:
14 (2d10 + 3) bludgeoning damage, and the target must succeed on a DC
15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. While poisoned,
the target is paralyzed. A poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw at
the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.
