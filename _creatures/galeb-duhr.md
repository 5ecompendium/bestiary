***False Appearance.*** While the galeb duhr remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal boulder.

***Rolling Charge.*** If the galeb duhr rolls at least 20 ft. straight toward a target and then hits it with a slam attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

### Actions

***Slam.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft ., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage.

***Animate Boulders (1/Day).*** The galeb duhr magically animates up to two boulders it can see within 60 ft. of it. A boulder has statistics like those of a galeb duhr, except it has Intelligence 1 and Charisma 1, it can't be charmed or frightened, and it lacks this action option. A boulder remains animated as long as the galeb duhr maintains concentration, up to 1 minute (as if concentrating on a spell) .
