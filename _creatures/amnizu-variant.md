***Devil's Sight.*** Magical darkness doesn't impede the amnizu's darkvision.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The amnizu's innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 19, +11 to hit with spell attacks). The amnizu can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

* At will: <i>charm person, command</i>

* 3/day each: <i>dominate person, fireball</i>

* 1/day each: <i>dominate monster, feeblemind</i>

***Magic Resistance.*** The amnizu has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Actions

***Multiattack*** The amnizu uses Poison Mind. It also makes two attacks: one with its whip and one with its Disruptive Touch.

***Taskmaster Whip*** Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d4 + 5) slashing damage plus 33 (6d10) force damage.

***Disruptive Touch*** Melee Spell Attack: +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 44 (8d10) necrotic damage.

***Poison Mind*** The amnizu targets one or two creatures that it can see within 60 feet of it. Each target must succeed on a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or take 26 (4d12) necrotic damage and is blinded until the start of the amnizu's next turn.

***Forgetfulness (Recharge 6)*** The amnizu targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. That creature must make a DC 18 Intelligence saving throw and on a failure the target is stunned for 1 minute. A stunned creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If the target remains stunned for the full minute, it forgets everything it sensed, experienced, and learned during the last 5 hours.

***Summon Devil (1/Day)*** The amnizu summons 2d4 bearded devils or 1d4 barbed devils. A summoned devil appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of the amnizu, acts as an ally of the amnizu, and can't summon other devils. It remains for 1 minute, until the amnizu dies, or until its summoner dismisses it as an action
