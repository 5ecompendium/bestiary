***Innate Spellcasting.*** The firebird's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 15). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

At will: guidance, purify food and drink, speak with animals

3/day each: charm person, cure wounds (2d8 + 5), daylight, faerie fire, heat metal, hypnotic pattern, tongues

1/day each: geas, heal, reincarnate

***Light of the World.*** The firebird's feathers glow with a warm light. The creature sheds light as dim as a candle or as bright as a lantern. It always sheds light, and any feathers plucked from the creature continue to shed light as a torch.

***Warming Presence.*** The firebird and any creatures within a 5-foot radius are immune to the effects of natural, environmental cold. Invited into a home or building, a firebird can expand this warming presence to its inhabitants no matter how close they are to the creature.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The firebird makes one bite attack and two claw attacks.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage.

***Blinding Ray (Recharge 5-6).*** The firebird can fire a burning ray of light from its tail feathers in a line 5 feet wide and up to 50 feet long. Targets in the line must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 24 (7d6) fire damage and become blinded for 1d4 rounds. A successful saving throw negates the blindness and reduces the damage by half.
