***Angelic Weapons.*** The Princip’s weapon attacks are
magical. When the Princip hits with any weapon,
the weapon deals an extra 9 (2d8) radiant damage
(included in the attack).

***Magic Resistance.*** The Princip has advantage on
saving throws against spells and other magical
effects from evil characters and sources.

***Aura of Protection Against Evil.*** Evil creatures have
disadvantage on attack rolls against all allies within
5 feet of the Princip. Allies in this area can’t be
charmed, frightened, or possessed by evil creatures.
If an ally is already charmed, frightened, or possessed
by evil magic, the ally has advantage on any new
saving throw against the relevant effect.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The Princip’s spellcasting ability
is Wisdom (spell save DC 14). It can innately cast the
following spells, requiring only verbal components:

* At will: <i>aid, enhance ability, lesser restoration, shield of faith</i>

* 3/day each: <i>haste, remove curse, stoneskin</i>

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The Princip makes three attacks with the
Scepter of Celestial Will.

***Scepter of Celestial Will.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to
hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage and 9 (2d8) radiant damage.

***Crown of Glory.*** The Princip selects an ally. A golden
crown appears over the ally’s head. While the crown
remains, the ally cannot be compelled to act in a
manner contrary to their will and may choose one
ability score to raise to 24. Each time the ally takes
damage while the crown is on them, they must make
a Constitution saving throw or lose the crown. The
DC equals 10 or half the damage taken, whichever
number is higher.
