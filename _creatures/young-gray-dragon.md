***Amphibious.*** The dragon can breathe air and water.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The dragon makes three attacks: one with its bite and two
with its claws.

(2d10 + 4) piercing damage plus 5 (1d10) fire damage.

(2d6 + 4) slashing damage.

Creatures in the area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On
a failed saving throw, the creature takes 52 (15d6) fire damage, or half as
much damage on a successful saving throw. Being underwater doesn’t
grant resistance to this damage.
