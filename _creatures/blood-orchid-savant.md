***Hyper-Awareness.*** The blood orchid cannot be surprised.

***Spellcasting.*** The blood orchid is a 4th level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 15, +7 to hit with spell attacks). It can cast the following spells:

* Cantrips (at will): <i>dancing lights, fire bolt, light, mage hand</i>

* 1st level (4 slots): <i>burning hands, color spray, detect magic, magic missile</i>

* 2nd level (3 slots): <i>darkness, ray of enfeeblement, scorching ray</i>

***Telepathic Bond.*** Blood orchids have a telepathic link to other blood orchids that are within 120 feet.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The blood orchid uses Blood Drain. It then makes up to three attacks with its tentacles.

***Tentacles.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d8 + 2) bludgeoning damage and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. The target is also grappled (escape DC 12). While grappled this way, the creature is restrained. Until the grapple ends, the blood orchid canâ€™t use this tentacle
on another target. The blood orchid has three tentacles that it can attack with.

***Blood Drain.*** The blood orchid feeds on the creature it is grappling. The creature must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by 5 (1d10). This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.
