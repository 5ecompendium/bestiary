***Fey Ancestry.*** The drow has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put the drow to sleep.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The drow's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 18). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

* At will: <i>dancing lights</i>

* 1/day each: <i>darkness, faerie fire, levitate </i>(self only)

***Spellcasting.*** The drow is a 11th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 18, +10 to hit with spell attacks). It has the following wizard spells prepared:

* Cantrips (at will): <i>mage hand, message, poison spray, shocking grasp, ray of frost</i>

* 1st level (4 slots): <i>burning hands, mage armor, magic missile, shield</i>

* 2nd level (3 slots): <i>gust of wind, invisibility, misty step, shatter</i>

* 3rd level (3 slots): <i>counterspell, fireball, haste</i>

* 4th level (3 slots): <i>dimension door, Otiluke's resilient sphere</i>

* 5th level (2 slots): <i>cone of cold</i>

* 6th level (1 slot): <i>chain lightning</i>

***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** While in sunlight, the drow has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

***War Magic.*** When the drow uses its action to cast a spell, it can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.

### Actions

***Multiattack*** The drow makes three scimitar attacks.

***Scimitar*** Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d6 + 5) slashing damage plus 18 (4d8) poison damage. In addition, the target has disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes against a spell the drow casts before the end of the drow's next turn.

***Hand Crossbow*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d6 + 5) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is also unconscious while poisoned in this way. The target regains consciousness if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it.
