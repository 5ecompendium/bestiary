***Sandstorm.*** At the start of each of the Templar’s
turns, each creature within 5 feet of it takes 5
(1d10) piercing damage.

***Scour (Recharge 5–6).*** The Templar moves up to
its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
It can move through creatures, and each creature
it passes through must make a DC 15 Constitution
saving throw or take 10 (3d6) force damage.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The Templar makes four attacks with
its halberd, Lightning, or Fire. Lightning and Fire
can only be used twice each.

***Halberd.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit,
reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (1d10 + 5) slashing
damage.

***Lightning.*** Ranged Spell Attack: +7 to hit, range
60 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (3d6) lightning damage.

***Fire.*** The Templar hurls a ball of fire that
explodes at a point it can see within 60 feet.
Each creature within a sphere of 10-foot radius
centered on that point must make a DC 15 Dexterity
saving throw. The sphere spreads around
corners. On a failed save, a creature takes 10
(3d6) fire damage, or half as much damage on a
successful one.
