### Actions

***Orange Blossom.*** The tri -flower frond chooses one creature it can see within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour.

The target must succeed on a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw, or it is covered with corrosive sap and takes 5 acid damage at the start of each of its turns. Dousing the target with water reduces the acid damage by 1 point per pint or flask of water used.
