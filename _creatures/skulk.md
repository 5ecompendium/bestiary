***Fallible Invisibility.*** The skulk is invisible. This invisibility can be circumvented by three things:
> The skulk appears as a drab, smooth-skinned humanoid if its reflection can be seen in a mirror or on another surface.
> The skulk appears as a dim, translucent form in the light of a candle made of fat rendered from a corpse whose identity is unknown.
> Humanoid children, aged 10 and under, can see through this invisibility.

***Trackless.*** The skulk leaves no tracks to indicate where it has been or where it's headed.

### Actions

***Claws*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d4 + 4) slashing damage. If the skulk has advantage on the attack roll, the target also takes 7 (2d6) necrotic damage.
