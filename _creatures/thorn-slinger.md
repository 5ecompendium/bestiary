***Adhesive Blossoms.*** The thorn slinger adheres to anything that touches it. A Medium or smaller creature adhered to the thorn slinger is also grappled by it (escape DC 11). Ability checks made to escape this grapple have disadvantage.

>At the end of each of the thorn slinger's turns, anything grappled by it takes 3 (1d6) acid damage.

***False Appearance.*** While the thorn slinger remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an inanimate bush.

### Actions

***Thorns.*** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (2d6 + 1) piercing damage.
