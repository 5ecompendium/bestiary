***Haste.*** When in need, a cave troll is capable of startling bursts of speed.
It has advantage on Dexterity saving throws and gains an additional action
on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one
claw), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action.

***Regeneration.*** The cave troll regains 6 hit points at the start of its turn.
If the cave troll takes acid or fire damage, this trait doesn’t function at the
start of the cave troll’s next turn. The cave troll dies only if starts its turn
with 0 hit points and doesn’t regenerate.

***Spider Climb.*** The cave troll can climb difficult surfaces, including
upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

### Actions

two with its claws.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 +4) piercing damage.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9
(2d4+4) slashing damage.
