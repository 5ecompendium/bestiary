***Keen Hearing and Smell.*** The hound has advantage
on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on
hearing or smell.

***Pack Tactics.*** The hound has advantage on an attack
roll against a creature if at least one of the hound’s
allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally
isn’t incapacitated.

***Flame Charge.*** If the hound moves at least 10 feet
straight toward a target and then hits it with a bite
attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra
13 (3d8) fire damage and must succeed on a DC
13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

### Actions

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5ft.,
one target. Hit: 9 (1d10 + 4) piercing damage plus
13 (3d8) fire damage.

***Horrifying Howl (1/Day).*** Each creature of the
hound’s choice that is within 60 feet and is not
deafened must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving
throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A
creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of
each of its turns, ending the fear on a success.
