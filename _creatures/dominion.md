***Angelic Weapons.*** The Dominion’s Ray of Salvation is magical. When the Dominion hits with it,
the ray deals an extra 9 (2d8) radiant damage
(included in the attack).

***Magic Resistance.*** The Dominion has advantage
on saving throws against spells and other magical
effects from evil characters and sources.

***Aura of Protection Against Evil.*** Evil creatures
have disadvantage on attack rolls against all
allies within 5 feet of the Dominion. Allies in this
area can’t be charmed, frightened, or possessed
by evil creatures. If an ally is already charmed,
frightened, or possessed by evil magic, the ally
has advantage on any new saving throw against
the relevant effect.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The Dominion makes two attacks
with the Ray of Salvation.

***Ray of Salvation.*** Ranged Spell Attack: +7 to hit,
range 60 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (3d6) fire damage
and 9 (2d8) radiant damage. If the ray does
damage, any allies adjacent to the target gain 10
temporary hit points.
