***Energized Body.*** A creature that hits the spire walker with a melee attack using a metal weapon takes 5 (1d10) lightning damage.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The spire walker's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 12, +4 to hit with spell attacks). The spire walker can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

* At will: <i>produce spark </i>(as the cantrip produce flame, but it does lightning damage)

* 3/day each: <i>dancing lights, feather fall, invisibility</i>

* 1/day each: <i>faerie fire, thunderwave</i>

***Steeple Step.*** The spire walker can use 10 feet of its movement to step magically from its position to the point of a steeple, mast, or other spire-like feature that is in view within 30 feet. The spire walker has advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks and Dexterity saving throws while it is standing on a steeple or any similar narrow, steep structure or feature.

### Actions

***Lightning Dart.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 1 piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) lightning damage. If the attack misses, the target still takes 4 (1d8) lightning damage. Whether the attack hits or misses its intended target, every other creature within 10 feet of the target takes 9 (2d8) lightning damage, or half damage with a successful DC 14 Dexterity saving throw.
