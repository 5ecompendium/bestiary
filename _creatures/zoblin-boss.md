***Undead Fortitude.*** If damage reduces the zoblin to 0 hit
points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a
DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is
radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the zoblin
drops to 1 hit point instead.

### Actions

***Scimitar.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5ft.,
one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage plus 2
(1d4) necrotic damage.

### Reactions

***Lingering Instincts.*** Whenever an enemy within 5ft.
misses the zoblin with an attack, it can use its reaction
to make a scimitar attack against that creature with
disadvantage.
