***Magic Resistance.*** The entity has advantage on saving
throws against spell and other magical effects.

***Magic Weapons.*** The entityâ€™s weapons are magical.

***Arcane Aura.*** The entity sheds bright light in a 15-foot
radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet. Any
magical items that are within this area become
mundane. This effect wears off when the entity dies or
when the item is taken out of the aura. Enemies that
end their turn in the bright light take 5 (1d10) force
damage.

### Actions

or two attacks with its whip.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5ft., one
target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) slashing damage plus 9 (2d8)
force damage.

***Arcane Whip.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach
15ft., one target. Hit: 7 (2d4 + 3) slashing damage plus
13 (3d8) force damage.

***Arcane Barrage (Recharge 5-6).*** The entity unleashes 10
(4d4) missiles of arcane power at randomly selected
enemies within 120 feet. The missiles automatically hit
and deal 6 (1d4 + 4) damage each.
