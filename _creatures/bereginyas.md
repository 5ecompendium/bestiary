### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The bereginyas makes two claw attacks. If both attacks hit the same target, the target is grappled (escape DC 12) and the bereginyas immediately uses Smother against it as a bonus action.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d8 + 5) slashing damage.

### Bonus Actions

***Smother.*** The bereginyas extends a semi-solid gaseous tendril down the grappled target's throat. The target must make a successful DC 14 Strength saving or it is immediately out of breath and begins suffocating. Suffocation ends if the grapple is broken or if the bereginyas is killed.
