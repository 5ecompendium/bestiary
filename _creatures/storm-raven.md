***Flyby.*** The raven doesn't provoke an opportunity
attack when it flies out of an enemy's reach.

***Magic Resistance.*** The raven has advantage on
saving throws against spells and other magical
effects.

***Lightning Charged.*** When the raven hits with a
melee attack, it deals an extra 2 (1d4) lightning
damage (included in the attack).

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The raven makes two attacks: one with
its beak and one with its talons. It then summons a
lightning orb.

***Beak.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5ft.,
one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage plus 2
(1d4) lightning damage.

***Talons.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5ft.,
one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage plus 2
(1d4) lightning damage.

***Summon Lightning Orb.*** The raven creates a 3 inch
diameter sphere of electricity in an unoccupied
space within 60 feet. This sphere persists for 1
minute or until the raven is killed. A creature that
ends its turn in the same space as a lightning orb
takes 3 (1d6) lightning damage. On initiative count
20, the orbs spark a 5-foot wide line of lighting
between all other orbs within 20 feet. Creatures
caught within one of these streaks of lightning
must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or
take 10 (3d6) lightning damage.
