***Improved Critical.*** The ghoul’s attacks score a critical hit
on a roll of 19 or 20.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The dust ghoul makes three attacks: one with
its bite and two with its claws.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) piercing damage.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (3d6 + 5) slashing damage.

***Blinding Dust (1/day).*** Blinding dust and sand swirls magically around
the ghoul. Each creature within 5 feet of the ghoul must succeed on a DC
15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of the creature’s
next turn.

***Paralyzing Shriek (Recharge 5–6).*** The dust ghoul unleashes a hellish
shriek. Each creature that is within 60 feet of the ghoul and can hear it
must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for
1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its
turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
