***Amphibious.*** The giant can breathe air and water.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The giant's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 17). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

* At will: <i>detect magic, feather fall, levitate, light</i>

* 3/day each: <i>control weather, water breathing</i>

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The giant makes two greatsword attacks.

***Greatsword.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 30 (6d6 + 9) slashing damage.

***Rock.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. Hit: 35 (4d12 + 9) bludgeoning damage.

***Lightning Strike (Recharge 5-6).*** The giant hurls a magical lightning bolt at a point it can see within 500 feet of it. Each creature within 10 feet of that point must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 54 (12d8) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
