***Legendary Resistance (1/Day).*** If the azer fails a
saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.
This effect is granted by the Azerâ€™s crown, so it if it
somehow lost, this ability cannot be used.

***Heated Body.*** A creature that touches the azer or
hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it
takes 6 (1d12) fire damage.

***Heated Weapons.*** When the azer hits with a metal
melee or ranged weapon, it deals an extra 7 (2d6)
fire damage (included in the attack).

***Illumination.*** The azer sheds bright light in a 15-foot
radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The azer makes two attacks with its
maul or two with its throwing hammers.

***Maul.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft.,
one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage,
plus 7 (2d6) fire damage.

***Throwing Hammer.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +8 to
hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d6 + 5)
bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) fire damage.

***Molten Slam (Recharge 5-6).*** The azer slams his maul
down with such devastating force that the ground
itself cracks open in a 30-foot cone and releases
lava. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15
Dexterity saving throw, taking 44 (8d10) fire
damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on
a successful one.
