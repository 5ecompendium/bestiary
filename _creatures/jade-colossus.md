***Immutable Form.*** The jade colossus is immune to any spell or effect
that would alter its form.

***Magic Resistance.*** The jade colossus has advantage on saving throws
against spell and other magical effects.

***Magic Weapons.*** The jade colossus’ weapon attacks are magical.

***Light Reflection.*** Any creature looking directly at the jade colossus
while the colossus is in bright light must make a DC 12 Constitution
saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. Additionally, attacks against the
colossus are made with disadvantage, and undead take 22 (4d10) radiant
damage if they start their turn within 60 feet of the colossus.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The jade colossus makes two slam attacks.

***Slam.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +15 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 36 (5d10 + 9) bludgeoning damage.

***Jade Blast (Recharge 5–6).*** The jade colossus unleashes a blast of green
energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18
Dexterity saving throw, taking 56 (16d6) force damage on a failed save,
or half as much damage on a successful one. Additionally, the creature
magically begins to turn to jade and is restrained. The restrained target
must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the
effect ends on the target. On a failure, the target is petrified until freed by
a greater restoration spell or other magic.

***Energy Ray (if embedded with the Ruby Star of Law).*** Once per round as a bonus action, the Jade
Guardian can fire a ray to a range of 200 feet. Genies hit by this ray
must make a successful DC 18 Constitution saving throw or take
17 (7d4) points of Constitution damage. On a successful save, the
genie takes half damage. Other creatures are affected as follows:
Lawful creatures suffer two levels of exhaustion. Non-lawful
creatures take 28 (8d6) force damage and are stunned for 1 minute.
Should the Ruby Star of Law ever be claimed as a magic item,
treat it as a minor artifact that allows use of the energy ray ability
indicated above up to 3/day, save that it requires a standard action
to activate.
