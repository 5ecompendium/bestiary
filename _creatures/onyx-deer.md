***Keen Smell.*** The onyx deer has advantage on Wisdom (Perception)
checks that rely on smell.

***Onyx Bite.*** Creatures bitten by an onyx deer must succeed on a
Constitution saving throw or slowly begin to turn into onyx (included in
the attack).

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The onyx deer makes four attacks: one bite, one gore,
and two with its hooves.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage and the creature must make a DC 14
Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature magically begins
to turn to onyx and is restrained. It must repeat the saving throw at the end
of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is
petrified in onyx until freed by a greater restoration spell or other magic.

***Gore.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d10 + 4) piercing damage.

***Hooves.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) slashing damage.

***Bellow (Recharge 5–6).*** The onyx deer unleashes a rumbling bellow.
Each creature that is within 60 feet of the onyx deer and able to hear it
must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1
minute. The frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of
each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
