***Dance of the Luckless (1/Day).*** Vila who dance for one hour create a fairy ring of small gray mushrooms. The ring lasts seven days and has a 50-foot diameter per dancing vila. Non.vila who fall asleep (including magical sleep) inside the ring have disadvantage on skill checks for 24 hours from the time they awaken.

***Forest Quickness.*** While in forest surroundings, a vila receives a +4 bonus on initiative checks.

***Forest Meld.*** A vila can meld into any tree in her forest for as long as she wishes, similar to the meld into stone spell.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The vila's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14). She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

3/day: sleep

1/week: control weather

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** A vila makes two shortsword attacks or two shortbow attacks.

***+1 Shortsword.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d6 + 6) piercing damage.

***+1 Shortbow.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d6 + 6) piercing damage.

***Fascinate (1/Day).*** When the vila sings, all those within 60 feet of her and who can hear her must make a successful DC 14 Charisma saving throw or be stunned for 1d4 rounds. Those who succeed on the saving throw are immune to that vila's singing for 24 hours.

***Forest Song (1/Day).*** The vila magically calls 2d6 wolves or 2 wampus cats. The called creatures arrive in 1d4 rounds, acting as allies of the vila and obeying its spoken commands. The beasts remain for 1 hour, until the vila dies, or until the vila dismisses them as a bonus action.
