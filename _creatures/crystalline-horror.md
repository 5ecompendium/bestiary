***Crystal Claws.*** The crystalline horror’s attacks are magical.

***Magic Resistance.*** The crystalline
horror has advantage on saving throws
against spells and other magical effects.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The crystalline horror can make two attacks
with its claws.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage.

***Shard Spray (Recharge 6).*** The crystalline horror launches a spray
of razor-sharp shards of glass from its body in a 30-foot cone. Each
creature in that area must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking
17 (5d6) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on
a successful one.

### Reactions

***Bend Light.*** The crystalline horror can refract natural light into a
bright light that makes it harder to be hit by melee attacks.
The crystalline horror adds 3 to its AC against one melee
attack that would hit it. To do so, the crystalline horror
must see the attack. This ability cannot be used in natural
or magical darkness.
