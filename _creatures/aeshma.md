***Innate Spellcasting.*** The demon’s spellcasting ability is Charisma
(spell save DC 15, +7 to hit with spell attacks). The demon can innately
cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

* At will: <i>blight, detect evil and good, dispel magic</i>

* 3/day each: <i>bestow curse, web</i>

***Magic Resistance.*** The aeshma demon has advantage on saving throws
against spells and other magical effects.

***Magic Weapons.*** The aeshma demon’s weapon attacks are magical.

***Reckless.*** At the start of its turn, the aeshma demon can gain advantage
on all melee weapon attack rolls it makes during that turn, but attack rolls
against it have advantage until the start of its next turn.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The aeshma demon makes two melee attacks.

***Spear.*** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft. or
range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (3d8 + 6) piercing damage.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d8 + 6) slashing damage.

***Summon Demon (1/day).*** The demon chooses what to summon
and attempts a magical summoning. An aeshma has a 30% chance of
summoning 1d3 vrocks, 1d2 hezrous, or one glabrezu.
A summoned demon appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of
its summoner, acts as an ally of its summoner, and can’t summon other
demons. It remains for 1 minute, until it or its summoner dies, or until its
summoner dismisses it as an action.
