***Cloud of Vermin.*** Any creature, other than a devil, that starts its turn within 20 feet of the nupperibo must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. A creature within the areas of two or more nupperibos makes the saving throw with disadvantage. On a failure, the creature takes 2 (1d4) piercing damage.

***Hunger-Driven.*** In the Nine Hells, the nupperibos can flawlessly track any creature that has taken damage from any nupperibo's Cloud of Vermin within the previous 24 hours.

### Actions

***Bite*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage.
