***Earth Glide.*** The dragon can burrow through nonmagical, unworked
earth and stone. While doing so, the elemental doesn’t disturb the material
it moves through.

***False Appearance.*** While the dragon remains motionless, it is
indistinguishable from a normal statue of a dragon.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The dragon’s innate spellcasting ability is
Charisma (spell save DC 18, +10 to hit with spell attacks). It can cast the
following spells, requiring no material components.

* At will: <i>meld into stone, stone shape</i>

* 3/day: <i>wall of stone</i>

* 1/day: <i>plane shift</i>

***Legendary Resistance (3/day).*** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can
choose to succeed instead.

***Siege Monster.*** The dragon deals double damage to objects and
structures.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The dragon can make three attacks: one with its bite and
two with its claws.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +15 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
Hit: 20 (2d10 + 9) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) fire damage.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +15 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target. Hit: 16 (2d6 + 9) slashing damage.

***Tail.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +15 to hit, reach 15 ft., one
target. Hit: 18 (2d8 + 9) bludgeoning damage.

***Shale and Stone Breath (Recharge 5–6).*** The dragon
releases a 60-foot cone of sand and gravel. Creatures
within the area must make a DC 22 Constitution saving
throw, taking 35 (10d6) fire damage plus 35 (10d6)
bludgeoning damage on a failed saving throw, or
half as much damage on a successful one. A
creature slain by this damage has its body
pulverized; it can only be restored to life by
<i>true resurrection</i> or <i>wish</i>.

### Legendary Actions

The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the
options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a
time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The dragon
regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

***Detect.*** The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.

***Tail Attack.*** The dragon makes a tail attack.

***Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).*** The dragon beats its
wings. Each creature within 15 feet of the dragon must
succeed on a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw or take 16 (2d6 + 9) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.
