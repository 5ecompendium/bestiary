### Actions

***Multiattack*** The merrenoloth uses Fear Gaze once and makes one oar attack.

***Oar*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (2d4 + 3) slashing damage.

***Fear Gaze*** The merrenoloth targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute.
