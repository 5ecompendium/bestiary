***Blatant Dismissal.*** While in the courts or castles of the fey, a monolith footman that scores a successful hit with its longsword can try to force the substitution of the target with a shadow double. The target must succeed at a DC 10 Charisma saving throw or become invisible, silent, and paralyzed, while an illusory version of itself remains visible and audible.and under the monolith footman's control, shouting for a retreat or the like. Outside fey locales, this ability does not function.

***Fey Flame.*** The ritual powering a monolith footman grants it an inner flame that it can use to enhance its weapon or its fists with additional fire or cold damage, depending on the construct's needs.

***Simple Construction.*** Monolith footmen are designed with a delicate fey construction. They burst into pieces and are destroyed when they receive a critical hit.

### Actions

***Longsword.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage plus 9 (2d8) cold or fire damage.
