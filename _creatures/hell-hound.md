***Keen Hearing and Smell.*** The hound has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.

***Pack Tactics.*** The hound has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the hound's allies is within 5 ft. of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.
