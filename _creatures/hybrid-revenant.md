***Explosive Despair.*** The suffering of the hybrid revenant is so great
that it explodes outward around itself from time to time, at random, as a
palpable and deadly force. At the beginning of the hybrid revenant’s
initiative, roll 1d6. On a one, the hybrid revenant doubles over
in apparent pain, incapacitated for this round. At the same
time, necrotic withering hurtles outward from the revenant
in a 30-foot radius. Each creature in this area must make
a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 71 (13d10)
damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one.

***Taint on the Land.*** If the hybrid revenant is merely
slain, the restless spirits that formed it will not be satisfied.
Deprived of a body, they will remain in waiting for
another like-minded soul to join them, and the process
will begin again (and in the meantime, the location
of its corpse will attract other undead to the area).
The hybrid revenant may be forcibly laid to rest
after its body is slain by casting hallow on any
physical remains. However, a hybrid revenant may
also be laid to rest through roleplay, for a party and
GM so inclined, by learning the revenant’s tale and
providing some form of solace, justice, epiphany, or
catharsis.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The hybrid revenant attacks once with
its bite and twice with its claws.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft.,
one target. Hit: 18 (2d12 + 5) piercing damage.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft.,
one target. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) slashing damage.

***Wail of the Yawning Void (Recharge 4–6).*** When a
hybrid revenant howls, those who hear its cry are consumed
by the nameless, gaping loss within the revenant’s soul.
All creatures within 60 feet of the revenant that can hear
it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be
stunned for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving
throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a
success. If the saving throw is successful, or the effect ends
on it, the creature is immune to the revenant’s Wail of the Yawning Void
for 24 hours.
