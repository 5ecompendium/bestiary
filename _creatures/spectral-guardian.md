***Incorporeal Movement.*** The spectral guardian can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

***Tomb Bound.*** The spectral guardian is bound to the area it defends. It can't move more than 100 feet from the place it is bound to protect.

***Withering Miasma.*** A creature that starts its turn in the spectral guardian's space must make a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 18 (4d8) necrotic damage and its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest.

An arcane guardian has a challenge rating of 8 (3,900 XP) and the following added trait: Spellcasting. The arcane guardian is a 9th level spellcaster.
