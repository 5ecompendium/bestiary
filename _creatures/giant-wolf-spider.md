***Spider Climb.*** The spider can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

***Web Sense.*** While in contact with a web, the spider knows the exact location of any other creature in contact with the same web.

***Web Walker.*** The spider ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.

### Actions

***Bite.*** Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 4 (1d6 + 1) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 7 (2d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target is stable but poisoned for 1 hour, even after regaining hit points, and is paralyzed while poisoned in this way.
