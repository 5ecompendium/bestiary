***Chilling Acid.*** The frostveil's frozen acidic mist breaks down flesh and organic materials into useable nutrients. Creatures who strike the frostveil with a non-reach melee weapon or an unarmed strike take 4 (1d8) acid damage.

***False Appearance.*** While the frostveil remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a formation of frost and ice.

***Windborne.*** While in blowing wind, the frostveil can fly with a speed of 30 feet. In a strong wind this speed increases to 60 feet.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The frostveil makes three tendril attacks.

***Tendril.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If two tendrils hit the same target in a single turn, the target is engulfed.

***Engulf.*** When a frostveil wraps itself around a Medium or smaller creature, the target takes 14 (2d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 13 (3d8) acid damage and is grappled (escape DC 15). The target takes another 9 (2d8) bludgeoning damage plus 13 (3d8) acid damage at the end of each of its turns when it's still grappled by the frostveil. A frostveil can't attack while it has a creature engulfed. Damage from attacks against the frostveil is split evenly between the frostveil and the engulfed creature; the only exceptions are slashing and psychic damage, which affect only the frostveil.

***Spirit Spores (recharge 6).*** In distress, frostveils release a puff of psychotropic spores in a 10-foot cloud around themselves. Creatures within the cloud of spores must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw against poison or suffer hallucinations, as per a confusion spell, for 1d3 rounds.
