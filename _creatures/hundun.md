***Brainless.*** Hunduns are immune to any spell or effect that allows an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw. Trying to contact or read a Hundun's mind confuses the caster as the spell for 1 round.

***Dance of Creation.*** Hunduns can perform an act of magical creation almost unlimited in scope every 1d8 days. The effect is equivalent to a wish spell, but it must create something.

***Enlightening Befuddlement.*** When a hundun's confusion spell affects a target, it can elect to use the following table rather than the standard one:

1d100 Result

***01-10 Inspired:.*** Advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws

***11-20 Distracted:.*** Disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws

***21-50 Incoherent:.*** The target does nothing but babble or scribble incoherent notes on a new idea

***51-75 Obsessed:.*** Target is recipient of geas to create a quality magical object

***76-100 Suggestible:.*** Target receives a suggestion from the hundun

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The hundun's innate spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 17). It can cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

Constant: confusion (always centered on the hundun), detect thoughts

At will: create or destroy water, dancing lights, mending, prestidigitation

3/day each: compulsion, dimension door, black tentacles, irresistible dance

1/day each: awaken, creation, heroes' feast, magnificent mansion, plant growth, reincarnate, stone shape

***Magic Weapons.*** The hundun's weapon attacks are magical.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The hundun makes four slam attacks.

***Slam.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (3d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage.
