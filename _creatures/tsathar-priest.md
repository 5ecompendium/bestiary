***Amphibious.*** The tsathar can breathe air and water.

***Keen Smell.*** The tsathar has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks
that rely on smell.

***Slimy.*** Tsathar continuously cover themselves with muck and slime.
Creatures attempting to grapple a tsathar do so with disadvantage.

***Standing Leap.*** The tsathar’s long jump is up to 20 feet and its high
jump is up to 10 feet, with or without a running start.

***Fetid Shroud of the Frog God.*** The priest of Tsathogga is surrounded
by a fetid, swirling shroud of foul corruption. At the start of each of the
priest’s turns, each creature within 5 feet of it takes 7 (2d6) poison damage.
A creature that touches the priest or hits it with a melee attack while within
5 feet of it takes 7 (2d6) poison damage.

***Fetid Strike.*** Once on each of the priest’s turns when it hits a creature
with a weapon attack, it can cause the attack to deal an extra 9 (2d8)
poison damage to the target.

***Spellcasting.*** The tsathar priest is a 5th level spellcaster. Its spellcasting
ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 13, +5 to hit with spell attacks). It has
the following cleric spells prepared:

* Cantrips (at will): <i>guidance, poison spray, resistance, thaumaturgy</i>

* 1st level (4 slots): <i>bane, bless, cure wounds, detect magic, inflict wounds</i>

* 2nd level (3 slots): <i>enhance ability, hold person, silence</i>

* 3rd level (3 slots): <i>bestow curse, dispel magic, stinking cloud</i>

### Actions

***Kukri.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5
(1d6 + 2) slashing damage.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit:
6 (1d8 + 2) slashing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13
Constitution saving throw or become the living host to a tsathar egg,
which over the course of the egg maturing, migrates to the chest cavity of
the host. The host creature must make another DC 13 Constitution saving
throw after 24 hours of the egg having been implanted. A failed saving
throw results in the host becoming violently ill, followed by a deep comalike state that lasts 2d6 + 2 days. At the end of each day, the host can
attempt another saving throw with a success indicating that its body has
managed to destroy the egg through normal immune response. At the end
of the incubation period, the host awakes to excruciating pain as the young
tsathar, freed from its egg, tears its way out of the host, who is reduced to
0 hit points in the process.

A DC 16 Wisdom (Medicine) check can be attempted to surgically
extract an egg from the host. A lesser restoration spell will also cure the
condition and purge the host of the egg.
