***Everchanging Changers.*** The Court of All Flesh are
beings of pure chaos. Because their minds are pure
disorder, they cannot be driven mad or charmed
and any attempts to magically compel their behavior fails.

***Formless Shape.*** Lord Rall is immune to any
spell or effect that would alter his form.

***Shapechanger.*** As an action, Lord Rall can polymorph into a Small or Medium creature or back
into his true form. His statistics, other than his size,
are the same in each form. Any worn or carried
equipment isn’t transformed. He reverts to his true
form if he dies.

***Spellcasting.*** Lord Rall is a 10th-level spellcaster.
His spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC
16, +8 to hit with spell attacks). He has the following wizard spells prepared:

* Cantrips (at will): <i>mage hand, minor illusion, ray of frost</i>

* 1st level (4 slots): <i>mage armor, magic missile, sleep</i>

* 2nd level (3 slots): <i>ray of enfeeblement, mirror image</i>

* 3rd level (3 slots): <i>lightning bolt, haste</i>

* 4th level (3 slots): <i>black tentacles, blight</i>

* 5th level (2 slots): <i>cloudkill</i>

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** Lord Rall makes two melee attacks
with the Staff of Changing.

***The Staff of Changing (Recharge 5–6).*** Lord Rall’s
staff remakes a target into any shape he desires.
He casts polymorph from it as an action. The range
is 30 feet, and the Wisdom saving throw has a DC
of 16. Lord Rall does not need to concentrate on
this spell to maintain it.

***Greatstaff.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach
5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (2d6 + 1) bludgeoning
damage, or 10 (2d8 + 1) bludgeoning damage if
wielded with two hands.

***Any Pile of Organs Will Do (Recharge 6).*** When he
drops to 0 hit points, Lord Rall can reform himself
from any corpse within 120 feet instead of falling
unconscious. Lord Rall does not need to see the
corpse in order to use it. The process happens in
an instant, and the newly formed Lord Rall appears
with only half of his maximum hit points.
