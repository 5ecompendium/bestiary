***Keen Smell.*** The bog beast has advantage on Wisdom (Perception)
checks based on smell.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The bog beast makes two attacks
with its claws.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit,
reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5)
slashing damage. If the target is a creature, it
must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving
throw against disease or become poisoned until
the disease is cured. Every 24 hours that elapse, the
target must repeat the saving throw, reducing its hit
point maximum by 5 (1d10) on a failure. The disease
is cured on a success. The target dies if the disease
reduces its hit point maximum to 0. This reduction of
the targetâ€™s hit point maximum lasts until
the disease is cured.
