***The Law of Fate.*** Fate does not make attack rolls,
always using a 12 as its result (before applying
bonuses) and cannot be affected by advantage
or disadvantage. Fate does not roll damage,
instead always taking the average result, though
damage dice are listed so the average can be calculated.

***Chaos Vulnerability.*** The Inexorables have disadvantage
on all saving throws against spells.

***Inexorable.*** The Inexorables are immune to any
effects that would slow them or deny them
actions or movement.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** Fate makes three slam attacks.

***Slam.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft.,
one target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage.

***The Destiny Light (Recharge 5â€“6).*** Fate fires
a beam of Destiny Light at a target it can see
within 60 feet. The target must make a DC 13
Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it
takes 36 (8d8) necrotic damage, and it only deals
average damage and uses 10 for its attack rolls
(before bonuses) for the next 10 minutes. On a
successful save, it takes half as much damage,
and its attack and damage rolls are not affected.
