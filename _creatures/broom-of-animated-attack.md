***Constructed Nature.*** An animated object doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

The magic that animates an object is dispelled when the construct drops to 0 hit points. An animated object reduced to 0 hit points becomes inanimate and is too damaged to be of much use or value to anyone.

***Antimagic Susceptibility.*** The broom is incapacitated while in the area of an antimagic field. If targeted by dispel magic, the broom must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against the caster's spell save DC or fall unconscious for 1 minute.

***False Appearance.*** While the broom remains motionless and isn't flying, it is indistinguishable from a normal broom.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The broom makes two melee attacks.

***Broomstick.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4+3) bludgeoning damage.

### Reactions

***Animated Attack.*** If the broom is motionless and a creature grabs hold of it, the broom makes a Dexterity check contested by the creature's Strength check. If the broom wins the contest, it flies out of the creature's grasp and makes a melee attack against it with advantage on the attack roll.
