***Blessing of Orcus.*** Black orcs have advantage on saving throws against
the spells and effects of undead creatures.

***Spellcasting.*** The black orc champion is a 7th level spellcaster. Its
spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 15, +7 to hit with spell
attacks). It has the following paladin spells prepared:

* 1st level (4 slots): <i>command, detect evil and good, false life, protection
from evil and good, shield of faith</i>

* 2nd level (3 slots): <i>magic weapon, silence, protection from poison</i>

***Unholy Strike.*** Once on each of the black orc championâ€™s turns when it
hits a creature with a melee weapon attack, the champion can cause the attack to
deal an extra 13 (3d8) necrotic damage to the target.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The black orc champion makes two melee attacks.

***Greatsword.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) slashing damage.

***Light Crossbow.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 80/320 ft.,
one target. Hit: 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage.

***Dreadful Glare (Recharges on a Short or Long Rest).*** Each enemy
within 30 feet of the champion must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving
throw or drop whatever it is holding and become frightened for 1 minute.
A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw on the end of each of its
turns, ending the effect on a success.

### Reactions

***Parry.*** The black orc champion adds 3 to its AC against one melee
attack that would hit it. To do so, the champion must see the attacker and
be wielding a melee weapon.
