***Controlled.*** Living wicks cannot move, attack, or perform actions when they are not lit. Living wicks only respond to the telepathic commands of the individual that lit them.

***Light.*** Activated living wicks produce light as a torch.

***Melting.*** A living wick loses one hit point for every 24 hours it remains lit.

### Actions

***Slam.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage.

***Consume Self.*** A living wick can be commanded to rapidly burn through the remains of its wick, creating a devastating fireball. All creatures within 20 feet of the living wick take 7 (2d6) fire damage, or half damage with a successful DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. The fire spreads around corners and ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried. The wick is reduced to a lifeless puddle of wax.
