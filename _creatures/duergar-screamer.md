***Engine of Pain.*** Once per turn, a creature that attacks the screamer can target the duergar trapped in it. The attacker has disadvantage on the attack roll. On a hit, the attack deals an extra 11 (2d10) damage to the screamer, and the screamer can respond by using its Multiattack with its reaction.

### Actions

***Multiattack*** The screamer makes one drill attack and uses its Sonic Scream.

***Drill*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (1d12 + 4) piercing damage.

***Sonic Scream*** The screamer emits destructive energy in a 15-foot cube. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 11 Strength saving throw or take 7 (2d6) thunder damage and be knocked prone.
