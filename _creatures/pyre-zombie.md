***Undead Fortitude.*** If damage reduces the zombie to 0 hit points, it
makes a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5+ the damage taken,
unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the
zombie drops to 1 hit point instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** The zombie has advantage on saving throws against
spells and other magical effects.

***Violent Combustion.*** Whenever the zombie is hit, it violently explodes.
Every creature with a 5-foot radius must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving
throw, taking 7 (2d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a
successful one.

### Actions

***Slam.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9
(2d6 + 1) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) fire damage.
