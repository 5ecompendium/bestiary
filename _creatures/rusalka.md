***Withered Tresses.*** If a rusalka is kept out of water for 24 consecutive hours, its hair and body dry into desiccated swamp weeds and the creature is utterly destroyed.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The rusalka's innate casting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 15). She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

At will: control water, suggestion, tongues, water walk (can be ended freely at will)

1/day: dominate person

***Watery Camouflage.*** In dim light or darkness, a rusalka that's underwater is invisible.

### Actions

***Breathless Kiss.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: the target is grappled (escape DC 13) and the rusalka draws all the air from the target's lungs with a kiss. If the rusalka has movement remaining, she drags the grappled creature into deep water, where it begins suffocating.

***Drowning Hair (1/Day).*** The rusalka's long hair tangles around a creature the rusalka has grappled. The creature takes 33 (6d10) necrotic damage, or half damage with a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw. In addition, until it escapes the rusalka's grapple, it is restrained and has disadvantage on Strength checks to break free of the grapple.
