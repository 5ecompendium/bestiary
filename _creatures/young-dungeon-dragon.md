***Special Equipment.*** The dragon is attuned to a crystal ball, which is
hidden somewhere within its labyrinthine lair. If a dungeon dragon loses
its crystal ball, it can create a new one over the course of 10 days.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The dungeon dragon’s innate spellcasting ability
is Charisma (spell save DC 16, +8 to hit with spell attacks). It can cast
the following spells, requiring no material components.

* At will: <i>alarm, arcane lock, detect magic, detect thoughts, find traps, glyph of warding, identify, knock</i>

* 3/day each: <i>dispel magic, hallucinatory terrain, locate creature, locate object, scrying, stone shape</i>

* 1/day each: <i>wall of stone</i>

***Labyrinthine Recall.*** The dungeon dragon can perfectly recall any path
it has traveled.

***Trap Master.*** The dungeon dragon has advantage on saving throws
against the effects of traps.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The dragon makes three attacks: one with its bite and two
with its claws.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 17
(2d10 + 6) piercing damage.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 13
(2d6 + 6) slashing damage.

***Confusion Breath (Recharge 5–6).*** The dragon exhales gas in a 30-foot
cone that spreads around corners. Each creature in that area must succeed
on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is
confused for 1 minute. While confused, the creature uses its action to
Dash in a random direction, even if that movement takes the creature into
dangerous areas. A confused creature can repeat the saving throw at the
end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.
