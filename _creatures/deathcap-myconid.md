***Distress Spores.*** When a deathcap myconid takes damage, all other myconids within 240 feet of it sense its pain.

***Sun Sickness.*** While in sunlight, the myconid has disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws. The myconid dies if it spends more than 1 hour in direct sunlight.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The myconid uses either its Deathcap Spores or its Slumber Spores, then makes a fist attack.

***Fist.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (4d4 + 1) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (4d4) poison damage.

***Deathcap Spores (3/day).*** The myconid ejects spores at one creature it can see within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 3 rounds. While poisoned this way, the target also takes 10 (4d4) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. The target repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Slumber Spores (3/day).*** The myconid ejects spores at one creature it can see within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned and unconscious for 1 minute. A creature wakes up if it takes damage, or if another creature uses its action to shake it awake.
