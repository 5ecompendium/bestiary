***Antimagic Susceptibility.*** The hsagrath is incapacitated while in the
area of an antimagic field. If targeted by dispel magic, the hsagrath must
succeed on a Constitution saving throw against the caster’s spell save DC
or fall unconscious for 1 minute.

***False Appearance.*** While the hsagrath remains motionless and isn’t
flying, it is indistinguishable from a normal chain.

***Fiendish Humor.*** When a target reaches 0 hit points, a hsgarath will
release and seek a new target.

### Actions

***Whip.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 30 ft., all targets within
range. Hit: 7 (1d8+3) bludgeoning damage.

***Constrict.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. Hit:
12 (2d8+3) bludgeoning damage and the target is grappled (Escape DC
16). A grappled opponent takes 12 (2d8+3) bludgeoning damage at the
beginning of its turn. The hsagrath can’t make any other attacks while it
has a creature grappled.
