***Shadow Stealth.*** When in dim light or darkness, the ghost-faced orc can
Hide as a bonus action.

***Spellcasting.*** The battle priest is a 9th level spellcaster. Its spellcasting
ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 16, +8 to hit with spell attacks). It has
the following cleric spells prepared:

* Cantrips (at will): <i>chill touch, guidance, mending, resistance, thaumaturgy</i>

* 1st level (4 slots): <i>bane, command, cure wounds, inflict wounds, protection from evil and good</i>

* 2nd level (3 slots): <i>blindness/deafness, enhance ability, hold person, silence, spiritual weapon</i>

* 3rd level (3 slots): <i>bestow curse, dispel magic, protection from energy, spirit guardians</i>

* 4th level (3 slots): <i>banishment, death ward</i>

* 5th level (1 slot): <i>insect plague</i>

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The battle priest makes two melee attacks.

***Mace.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12
(2d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage.

### Reactions

***Summon Demon (1/day).*** When the battle priest drops a hostile target
to 0 hit points, the battle priest can attempt to summon a chaaor demon. It
has a 45% chance of succeeding on this attempt. The summoned demon
appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of the battle priest and canâ€™t
summon other demons. It remains for 1 minute, until it or the battle priest
is slain, or until the battle priest takes an action to dismiss it.
