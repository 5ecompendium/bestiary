***Tortured Mind.*** The mind of an Abyssal larva cannot be read. If a
creature attempts to read an Abyssal larvaâ€™s mind, it takes 7 (2d6) psychic
damage and must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed
saving throw, the creature is poisoned for 1 minute. While poisoned, the
creature cannot take reactions and uses their action to Dash in a random
direction, even if that leads them into dangerous areas.

### Actions

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (2d4 + 1) piercing damage plus 5 (2d4) acid damage.

***Maggot Spray.*** Ranged Spell Attack: +3 to hit, range 10 ft., one target.
Hit: 1 poison damage and the target must succeed a DC 12 Dexterity
saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. A poisoned creature can make
a DC 12 Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending
the poisoned effect on a success.
