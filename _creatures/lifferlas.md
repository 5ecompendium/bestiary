### Roleplaying Information

A druid of the Emerald Enclave awakened the tree Lifferlas with a spell. Goldenfields is his home, its people his friends. Children like to carve their name and initials into his body and hang from his boughs, and he's happy with that.

**Ideal:** "I exist to protect the people and plants of Goldenfields."

**Bond:** "Children are wonderful. I would do anything to make them feel happy and safe."

**Flaw:** "I can't remember people's names and often get them mixed up."
