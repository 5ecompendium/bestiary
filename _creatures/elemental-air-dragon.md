***Innate Spellcasting.*** The elemental dragon’s innate
spellcasting is Charisma (spell save DC 18, +10 to hit with
spell attacks). It can cast the following spell requiring no
material components.

* At will: <i>gust of wind</i>

* 3/day each: <i>call lightning, wind wall</i>

* 1/day each: <i>control weather, plane shift</i>

***Legendary Resistance (3/day).*** If the dragon fails a saving
throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The dragon makes three attacks: one with its bite and two
with its claws.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 19
(2d10 + 8) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) fire damage.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15
(2d6 + 8) slashing damage.

***Tail.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 17
(2d8 + 8) bludgeoning damage.

***Scalding Breath (Recharge 5–6).*** The dragon releases a 60-foot cone of
superheated air that wraps around corners. Creatures within the area must
make a DC 21 Constitution saving throw, taking 63 (18d6) fire damage on
a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Whirlwind (Recharge 5–6).*** The dragon creates a cyclone in a 30-
foot radius centered on itself. Creatures, other than the dragon, within
the area can only move half their normal movement, nonmagical ranged
attacks automatically fail, and all nonmagical unprotected flames are
automatically extinguished. Large or smaller creatures within the area
must also succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving throw. On a failed saving
throw, the creature takes 20 (3d8 + 7) bludgeoning damage and is knocked
prone and pushed 30 in a random direction. On a successful saving throw,
the creature takes half damage and is not otherwise affected.

### Legendary Actions

The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options
below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only
at the end of another creature’s turn. The dragon regains spent legendary
actions at the start of its turn.

***Detect.*** The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.

***Tail Attack.*** The dragon makes a tail attack.

***Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).*** The dragon beats its wings. Each
creature within 15 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 21 Dexterity
saving throw or take 15 (2d6 + 8) bludgeoning damage and be knocked
prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.
