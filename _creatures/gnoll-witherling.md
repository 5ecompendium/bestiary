***Rampage.*** When the witherling reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack on its turn, it can take a bonus action to move up to half its speed and make a bite attack.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The witherling makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its club, or two with its club.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d4+2) piercing damage.

***Club.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d4+2) bludgeoning damage.

### Reactions

***Vengeful Strike.*** In response to a gnoll being reduced to 0 hit points within 30 feet of the witherling, the witherling makes a melee attack.
