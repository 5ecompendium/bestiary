***Arcane Advantage.*** Once per turn, the hobgoblin can deal an extra 7 (2d6) damage to a creature it hits with a damaging spell attack if that target is within 5 feet of an ally of the hobgoblin and that ally isn't incapacitated.

***Army Arcane.*** When the hobgoblin casts a spell that causes damage or that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, it can choose itself and any number of allies to be immune to the damage caused by the spell and to succeed on the required saving throw.

***Spellcasting.*** The hobgoblin is a 7th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 13, +5 to hit with spell attacks). It has the following wizard spells prepared:

* Cantrips (at will): <i>acid splash, fire bolt, ray of frost, shocking grasp</i>

* 1st level (4 slots): <i>fog cloud, magic missile, thunderwave</i>

* 2nd level (3 slots): <i>gust of wind, Melf's acid arrow, scorching ray</i>

* 3rd level (3 slots): <i>fireball, fly, lightning bolt</i>

* 4th level (1 slot): <i>ice storm</i>
