***Magic Scent.*** The thaumaturmite can pinpoint, by scent, the location of
any magical cloth within 30 feet of it.

***Consume Magic.*** Any magical cloth that the thaumaturmite hits starts
to corrode. Each time the thaumaturmite bites into
a magical cloth which is worn or carried,
the bearer of the item must make
a successful DC 12 Dexterity
saving throw or the item starts
corroding. After two failed
saving throws the item loses
its magical qualities.

***Spider Climb.*** The thaumaturmite can climb difficult surfaces, including
upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

***Magic Resistance.*** The thaumaturmite has advantage on saving throws
against spells and other magical effects.

### Actions

***Bite.*** Melee weapon attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit:
25 (5d8+3) piercing damage.
