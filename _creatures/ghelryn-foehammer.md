### Roleplaying Information

The blacksmith Ghelryn has a good heart, but he hates orcs and giants - hates them with a fiery passion. He considers it the solemn duty of all dwarves to cave in their skulls!

**Ideal:** It is incumbent upon every dwarf to forge a legacy.

**Bond:** I stand for Clan Foehammer and all dwarvenkind.

**Flaw:** I never run from a figth, especially if it involves killing orcs or giants.
