***Brave.*** The gladiator has advantage on saving throws against being frightened.

***Brute.*** A melee weapon deals one extra die of its damage when the gladiator hits with it (included in the attack).

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The gladiator makes three melee attacks or two ranged attacks.

***Spear.*** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. and range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage, or 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack.

***Shield Bash.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 9 (2d4 + 4) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

### Reactions

***Parry.*** The gladiator adds 3 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the gladiator must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
