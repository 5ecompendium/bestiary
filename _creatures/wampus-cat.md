* At will: <i>disguise self </i>(appearance of a female human)<i>, mage hand</i>

* 2/day: <i>hex</i>

### Actions

***Yowl (Recharge 5-6).*** Intelligent creatures within 60 feet of the cat who are able to hear its voice must make a DC 13 Charisma saving throw. Those who fail find the sound of the wampus cat's voice pleasant and alluring, so that the cat has advantage on Charisma checks against them for 1 minute.
