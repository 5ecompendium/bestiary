At will: darkness, dispel magic, fear, heat metal, levitate

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The babau makes two melee attacks. It can also use Weakening Gaze before or after making these attacks.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft, one target. Hit: 8 (1d8+4) slashing damage.

***Spear.*** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 it, one target. Hit: 7 (1d6+4) piercing damage, or 8 (1d8+4) piercing damage when used with two hands to make a melee attack.

***Weakening Gaze.*** The babau targets one creature that it can see within 20 feet of it. The target must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target deals only half damage with weapon attacks that use Strength for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
