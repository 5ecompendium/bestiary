***Formless Shape.*** Maladar is immune to any spell or
effect that would alter his form.

***Reform.*** Each time Maladar takes damage in
combat, his arm grows another limb, increasing
the damage of his smash attack by 1d8. There is no
limit to the number of limbs, tentacles, and claws
Maladar can grow this way.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** Maladar makes two attacks with
Changer plus one smash attack.

***Changer (Greatsword).*** Melee Weapon Attack: +9
to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage.

***Smash.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft.,
one target. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage.

***Lord of Chaos.*** Maladar has a 50% chance of
summoning a member of his court in an adjacent unoccupied space. If successful, roll a d12
and consult the below chart. Each member of his
court may only be summoned once per day in this
manner. If the same member is summoned twice,
nothing happens.
* 1-4: Baron Malgas
* 5–7: Korsoth Vastikan
