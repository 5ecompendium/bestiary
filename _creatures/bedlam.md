***Chaotic Resonance.*** The bedlam emanates an aura of pure chaos. The
aura deals 7 (2d6) psychic damage to any creature that ends its turn within
30 feet of the bedlam. Creatures attempting to cast a spell or use a magic
item in this area have a 50% chance of the spell fizzling or the item not
functioning. Creatures that are chaotic in nature ignore the effect of the
bedlam’s chaotic resonance.

***Magic Resistance.*** The bedlam has advantage on saving throws against
spells and other magic effects.

***Sense Law.*** The bedlam can sense the presence and location of any
creature within 120 feet of it that is lawfully aligned, regardless of
interposing barriers, unless the creature is protected by a spell such as
nondetection.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The bedlam makes two slam attacks.

***Slam.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 14
(2d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage.

***Chaos Burst (Recharge 5–6).*** The bedlam releases a burst of crackling
gray energy in a 20-foot radius. Creatures in this area must make a DC 14
Wisdom saving throw, taking 22 (5d8) psychic damage on a failed save,
and half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures that are chaotic
in nature ignore the bedlam’s chaos burst.
