***Potent Poison.*** The death butterfly swarm's poison affects corporeal undead who are otherwise immune to poison.

***Swarm.*** The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny insect. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit point.

***Weight of Wings.*** A creature in a space occupied by the death butterfly swarm has its speed reduced by half, and must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or become blinded. Both effects end when the creature doesn't share a space with the swarm at the end of the creature's turn. If a creature succeeds on the saving throw, it is immune to the swarm's blindness (but not the speed reduction) for 24 hours.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The swarm makes a Bite attack against every target in its spaces.

***Bites.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 0 ft., every target in the swarm's space. Hit: 22 (6d6 +1) piercing damage, or 11 (3d6 + 1) piercing damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer. The target also takes 10 (3d6) poison damage and becomes poisoned for 1d4 rounds; a successful DC 13 Constitution saving throw reduces poison damage by half and prevents the poisoned condition..
