***Death Sense.*** The hellcat can sense the exact
location of any humanoid within 120 feet with less
than half its hit points.

***False Appearance.*** Unless it is using
its Death Gaze ability, the hellcat is
indistinguishable from a normal housecat.

***Magic Resistance.*** The hellcat has
advantage on saving throws against
spells and other magical effects.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The hellcat makes one bite attack and one claw attack.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9
(2d6 + 2) slashing damage.

***Death Gaze (Recharge 5–6).*** One target within 30 feet of the hellcat
that it can see must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failed
saving throw, the target takes 27 (6d8) necrotic damage. If the creature
drops to 0 hit points from this damage, it dies, and can only be restored to
life by means of a true resurrection or wish spell.
