***Legion of Puppets.*** The puppeteer crafts and distributes
Grinning Marionettes. The puppeteer may use its
action to see through the eyes of any of its
marionettes. While seeing through the eyes of a
marionette, the puppeteer is blind to everything
happening around its body. The puppeteer is in
constant telepathic communication with all of its
puppets and they follow its will.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The puppeteer’s innate spellcasting
ability is Charisma (spell save DC 15). It can innately
cast the following spells, requiring no components:

* At will: <i>alter self, charm person, crown of madness</i>

* 3/Day: <i>dominate person, hold person</i>

***Master Ventriloquist.*** The puppeteer can cast spells
without any somatic or verbal components and can
perfectly mimic any voice it has ever heard.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The puppeteer makes three attacks with its
razor strings.

***Razor Strings.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach
15ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage.

***Strings Attached (Recharge 5-6).*** The puppeteer
teleports to an unoccupied space within 120 feet and
makes three attacks with its razor strings against a
single target, then casts dominate person on them. If at
least two of puppeteer’s attacks hit, the target has
disadvantage on their saving throw against the spell.
