***Hyper-Awareness.*** The gloom crawler has advantage on Wisdom
(Perception) checks and on saving throws against being blinded.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The gloom crawler makes three tentacles attacks and one
bite attack.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d8 + 7) piercing damage.

crawler can grapple up to three different targets.
