***Magic Resistance.*** The spider has advantage on saving throws against
spells and other magical effects.

***Magic Weapons.*** The spiderâ€™s weapon attacks are magical.

***Spider Climb.*** The spider can climb difficult surfaces, including upside
down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

***Web Sense.*** While in contact with a web, the spider knows the exact
location of any other creature in contact with the same web.

***Web Walker.*** The spider ignores movement restrictions caused by
webbing.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The spider can make one bite attack and two puncture
attacks with its legs.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d10 + 3) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 12 Constitution
saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) poison damage on a failed save, or half as
much damage on a success. If the poison damage reduces the target to 0
hit points, the target is stable but poisoned for 1 hour, even after regaining
hit points, and is paralyzed while poisoned in this way.

***Puncture.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit:
14 (2d10 + 3) piercing damage.
