***Keen Senses.*** The retch hound has advantage on Wisdom (Perception)
checks that rely on hearing, sight, or smell.

***Pack Tactics.*** Retch hounds have advantage on an attack roll against a
creature if at least one of the hound’s allies is within 5 feet of the creature
and the ally isn’t incapacitated.

### Actions

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (2d6 + 2) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) acid damage.

***Retch (Recharge 5–6).*** The retch hound exhales acidic bile in a 15-foot
cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving
throw, taking 21 (6d6) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much on
a successful one.
