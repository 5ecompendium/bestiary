### Roleplaying Information

A retired adventurer, Urgala owns a respectable inn, the Northshield House, and she doesn't want to see it or her neighbours' homes destroyed. She has no tolerance for monsters or bullies.

**Ideal:** We live in a violent world, and sometimes violence is necessary for survival.

**Bond:** My home is my life. Threaten it, and I'll hurt you.

**Flaw:** I know how treacherous and greedy adventurers can be. I don't trust them - any of them.
