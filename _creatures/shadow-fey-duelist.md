***Fey Ancestry.*** The shadow fey has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put it to sleep.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The shadow fey's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma. It can cast the following spells innately, requiring no material components.

3/day: misty step (when in shadows, dim light, or darkness only)

***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** While in sunlight, the shadow fey has disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

***Traveler in Darkness.*** The shadow fey has advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks made to know about shadow roads and shadow magic spells or items.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The shadow fey makes two rapier attacks. If it has a dagger drawn, it can also make one dagger attack.

***Dagger.*** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d4 + 5) piercing damage, and a target creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. A poisoned creature repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

***Rapier.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d8 + 5) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage.

### Reactions

***Parry.*** The shadow fey duelist adds 3 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the duelist must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
