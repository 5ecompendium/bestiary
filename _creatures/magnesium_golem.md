***Aura of Sickness.*** Creatures who begin their turn within 10 feet of
the golem must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed
saving throw, the creature is poisoned for 1 minute. If a creature ends its
turn outside the 10-foot area, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the
effect on a success. If the creature succeeds or if the effect ends for it, it is
immune to the golem’s aura of sickness for 24 hours.

***Fire Absorption.*** Whenever the golem is subjected to fire damage, it
takes no damage and instead regains a number of hit points equal to the
fire damage dealt.

***Immutable Form.*** The golem is immune to any spell or effect that
would alter its form.

***Magic Resistance.*** The golem has advantage on saving throws against
spells and other magical effects.

***Magic Weapon.*** The golem’s weapon attacks are magical.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The golem makes two slam attacks.

***Slam.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13
(2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.
