***Disgorge Zombie.*** As a bonus action , the tyrannosaurus zombie can disgorge a normal zombie, which appears in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of it. The disgorged zombie acts on its own initiative count. After a zombie is disgorged, roll a d6. On a roll of l, the tyrannosaurus zombie runs out of zombies to disgorge and loses this trait . If the tyrannosaurus zombie still has this trait when it dies, ld4 normal zombies erupt from its corpse at the start of its next turn. These zombies act on their own initiative count.

***Undead fortitude.*** If damage reduces the tyrannosaurus zombie to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the zombie drops to 1 hit point instead.

### Actions

***Tail.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 20 (3d8 +7) bludgeoning damage.
