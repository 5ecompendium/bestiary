***False Appearance.*** While the scarecrow remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary, inanimate scarecrow.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The scarecrow makes two claw attacks.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (2d4 + 1) slashing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the end of the scarecrow's next turn.

***Terrifying Glare.*** The scarecrow targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see the scarecrow, the target must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or be magically frightened until the end of the scarecrow's next turn. The frightened target is paralyzed.
