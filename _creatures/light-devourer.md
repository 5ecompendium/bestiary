***Shrouded in Darkness.*** The area in a 30 foot area
around the devourer is shrouded in magical
darkness and cannot be pierced by any light,
magical or mundane.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The devourer makes three attacks, one
with its bite and two with its claws.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5ft.,
one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage and
the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution
saving throw or be blinded until the end of their
next turn.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5ft.,
one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage.

***Consume Sight (Recharge 5-6).*** The light devourer
drains any and all light from within its shroud of
darkness. All other creatures in that area must
succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or
be blinded. A blinded creature can repeat the saving
throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the
blinded condition on itself on a success.
