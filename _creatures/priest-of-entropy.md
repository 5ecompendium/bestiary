***Spellcasting.*** The priest is a 12th level spellcaster. Its
spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 15, +7 to
hit with spell attacks). It has the following cleric spells
prepared:

* Cantrips (at will): <i>guidance, light, resistance, sacred flame, thaumaturgy</i>

* 1st level (4 slots): <i>bane, detect magic, guiding bolt, healing word, inflict wounds</i>

* 2nd level (3 slots): <i>gentle repose, hold person, spiritual weapon, silence</i>

* 3rd level (3 slots): <i>animate dead, dispel magic, mass healing word, meld into stone, protection from energy, sending</i>

* 4th level (3 slots): <i>banishment, blight, death ward</i>

* 5th level (2 slots): <i>contagion, circle of power, hallow, insect plague</i>

* 6th level (1 slot): <i>forbiddance, true seeing</i>

### Actions

***Spear.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft. or
ranged 20/60 ft., one creature. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing
damage, or 6 (1d8+2) piercing damage if used with two
hands to make a melee attack.

***Arcane Disruption.*** The priest conjures an aura of
disruptive energy that radiates from it in a 15 foot
radius and moves with the priest, centered on it. The
aura lasts until the priest dismisses it as action, or dies.
While inside the aura, any creature that attempts to
cast a spell must first succeed on a DC 15 Constitution
saving throw. If they fail the save, their spell fails to cast
and the spell slot is wasted.
