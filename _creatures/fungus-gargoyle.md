***False Appearance.*** While the gargoyle remains motionless, it is
indistinguishable from a weathered, inanimate statue that is covered in
fungus, lichen, and moss.

***Stench.*** Any creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the gargoyle
must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until
the start of its next turn. On a successful saving throw, the creature is
immune to the gargoyle’s stench for 24 hours.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The gargoyle makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage.

***Deadly Spores (Recharge 5–6).*** The fungus gargoyle exhales deadly
spores in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15
Constitution saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) poison damage on a failed
save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
