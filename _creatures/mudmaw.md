***False Appearance.*** While the mudmaw remains
motionless, it is indistinguishable from a floating log.

***Hold Breath.*** The mudmaw can hold its breath for 15 minutes.

***Soften Earth.*** While on land, the ground in a 15 feet
radius around the mudmaw is difficult terrain.

### Actions

one creature. Hit: 21 (3d10 + 5) piercing damage.

***Tentacles.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach
20 ft., one creature. Hit: The target is grappled
