***Charge.*** If the minotaur moves at least 10 feet straight toward a target
and then hits it with a gore attack on the same turn, the target takes an
extra 9 (2d8) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed
on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 feet away and
knocked prone.

***Horrific Appearance.*** All creatures who directly look at the minotaur
must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. A
creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending
the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful
or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the minotaur’s horrific
appearance for the next 24 hours.

***Magic Resistance.*** The minotaur has advantage on saving throws
against spells and other magic effects.

***Magic Weapons.*** The minotaur’s attacks are magical.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The bleeding horror minotaur uses its gore attack, and
makes one attack with its claw and one with its greataxe, or two with its
claws.

***Gore.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 13
(2d8 + 4) piercing damage.

***Greataxe.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit:
11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage.
