***Undead Swarm Fortitude.*** The swarm fights at full
strength until it is completely destroyed.

***Swarm.*** The swarm can occupy another creature's
space and vice versa, and the swarm can move
through any opening large enough for a Small
goblin. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain
temporary hit points.

***Plagued.*** When the swarm hits with an attack, it
deals an extra 10 (3d6) necrotic damage (included
in the attack).

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The swarm uses its pull under ability if
able, then uses its gnaw and claw attack.

***Gnaw and Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit,
reach 0 ft., one target in the swarm’s space. Hit: 11
(2d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic
damage, and the target must succeed a DC 12
Constitution saving throw or become poisoned
until the end of their next turn.

***Pull Under.*** The swarm attempts to envelope a
creature within its space. The target must succeed
on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or be knocked
prone and considered grappled (escape DC 12) as
they are pinned to the ground under a sea of
zombies. This ability can only be used if the swarm
is above half of its maximum hit points.
