***Heated Body.*** A creature that touches the azer or
hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it
takes 5 (1d10) fire damage.

***Superheated Equipment.*** When the azer captain hits
with a metal melee weapon, it deals an extra 7
(2d6) fire damage (included in the attack).

***Illumination.*** The azer captain sheds bright light in a
15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15
feet.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The azer captain makes two attacks:
one with its warhammer and one shield bash.

***Warhammer.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach
5ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning
damage plus 7 (2d6) fire damage.

***Shield Bash.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach
5ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) bludgeoning
damage and the target must succeed on a DC 14
Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the
end of its next turn.

***Ignition (1/Day).*** The azer captain lets out a powerful
rallying cry that increases the internal flames within
all allies within 120 feet that can see it or hear it.
For the next minute, these azer have the damage of
their Heated Body increased by one dice category
to a maximum of 1d12 and gain 10 temporary hit
points.

### Reactions

***Flame Barrier.*** The azer captain adds 3 to its AC
against a ranged spell attack that would hit it by
raising his shield and creating a protective barrier of
flame. If the attack is still successful, the attacker
takes 5 (1d10) fire damage as a spiral of flame
tracks the spell back to its origin. To use this ability,
the azer captain must see the attack and be
wielding a shield.
