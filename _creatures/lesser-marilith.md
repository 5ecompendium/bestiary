***Magic Resistance.*** The lesser marilith has advantage on saving throws against spells and other
magical effects.

***Magic Weapons.*** The lesser marilithâ€™s weapon attacks
are magical.


### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The lesser marilith makes three attacks
with its longsword and one attack with its tail.

***Longsword.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5
ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage.

***Tail.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one
creature. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage. If the
target is Medium or smaller, it is grappled (escape DC
14). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained,
the lesser marilith can automatically hit the target
with its tail, and the lesser marilith cannot make tail
attacks against other targets.

### Reactions

***Parry.*** The lesser marilith can add 5 to its AC against
one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the
lesser marilith must see the attacker and be wielding
a melee weapon.
