(Perception) checks that rely on smell.

***Siege Monster.*** The Elasmotherium deals double damage to objects and
structures.

***Trample.*** If the Elasmotherium moves at least 20 feet straight toward
a creature and then hits it with a gore attack on the same turn, that target

the target is prone, the Elasmotherium can make stomp on the target as a
bonus action.
