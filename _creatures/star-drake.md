***Legendary Resistance (2/day).*** If the star drake fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** The drake has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Magic Weapons.*** The drake's weapon attacks are magical.

***Nimbus of Stars.*** The drake is surrounded by a whirling nimbus of tiny motes of starlight. A sighted creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the drake must make a successful DC 18 Constitution saving throw or become incapacitated. At the start of a character's turn, a character can choose to avert its eyes and gain immunity against this effect until the start of its next turn, but it must treat the drake as invisible while the character's eyes are averted.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The drake's innate spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 20). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

At will: faerie fire, moonbeam

3/day: plane shift

1/day each: gate, planar binding

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The drake makes one bite attack and two claw attacks.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d10 + 5) piercing damage.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (3d6 + 5) slashing damage.

***Breath Weapon (Recharge 5-6).*** The drake exhales either fire or frigid air in a 40-foot cone. Each creature in that area takes 78 (12d12) fire or cold damage, whichever the drake wishes, or half damage with a successful DC 18 Dexterity saving throw.

***Searing Star (1/Day).*** Ranged Spell Attack: +12 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 65 (10d12) force damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be permanently blinded.

### Legendary Actions

***The drake can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below.*** Only one option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The drake regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

***Bite Attack.*** The drake makes one bite attack.

***Nova (Costs 2 Actions).*** The drake momentarily doubles the radius and intensity of its nimbus of stars. Every sighted creature within 20 feet of the drake must make a successful DC 18 Constitution saving throw or become blinded until the end of its next turn. Characters who are averting their eyes are immune to the nova.

***Pale Sparks.*** The drake casts faerie fire or moonbeam.
