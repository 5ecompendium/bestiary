***Dimensional Lock.*** Other creatures can't teleport to or from a space within 60 feet of the canoloth. Any attempt to do so is wasted.

***Magic Resistance.*** The canoloth has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Magic Weapons.*** The canoloth's weapon attacks are magical.

***Uncanny Senses.*** The canoloth can't be surprised while it isn't incapacitated.

### Actions

***Multiattack*** The canoloth makes two attacks: one with its tongue or its bite and one with its claws.

***Bite*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 25 (6d6 + 4) piercing damage.

***Claws*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d10 + 4) slashing damage.

***Tongue*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, range 30 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (2d12 + 4) piercing damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it is grappled (escape DC 15), pulled up to 30 feet toward the canoloth, and is restrained until the grapple ends. The canoloth can grapple one target at a time with its tongue.
