***Undead Fortitude.*** If damage reduces the zombie to 0 hit points, it
must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage
taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the
zombie drops to 1 hit point instead.

### Actions

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10
(2d6 + 3) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage.
