***Divine Aura.*** Each time an aberration, fiend, or undead attempts
to make a melee or ranged attack against the wrath dragon from
within 10 feet of the dragon, the creature must succeed on a
DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or be forced to target another
creature within range or lose the action. Once a creature
succeeds on this saving throw, it is immune to it for 24
hours.

***Legendary Resistance (3/day).*** If the dragon fails a
saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

saving throw.

***Beckon Deva (1/day).*** The wrath dragon summons a deva from the deity

feet of the wrath dragon. It remains for 1 minute, until it or the wrath dragon
is slain, or until the wrath dragon takes an action to dismiss it.
