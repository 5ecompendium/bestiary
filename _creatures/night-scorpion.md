### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The scorpion makes three attacks: two with its claws and one with its sting.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d8 + 2) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 12). The scorpion has two claws, each of which can grapple one target.

***Sting.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 (1d10 + 2) piercing damage, and the target takes 7 (2d6) poison damage and is blinded for 1d3 hours; a successful DC 12 Constitution saving throw reduces damage by half and prevents blindness. If the target fails the saving throw by 5 or more, the target is also paralyzed while poisoned. The poisoned target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a successful save.
