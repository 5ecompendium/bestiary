***Charge.*** If the obsidian minotaur moves at least 10 feet straight toward
a target and then hits it with a gore attack on the same turn, the target
takes an extra 9 (2d8) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must
succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 feet away
and knocked prone.

***Immutable Form.*** The minotaur is immune to any spell or effect that
would alter its form.

***Magic Resistance.*** The minotaur has advantage on saving throws
against spells and other magic effects.

***Magic Weapons.*** The minotaur’s weapon attacks are magical.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The obsidian minotaur makes one gore attack and two
claw attacks.

***Gore.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14
(2d8 + 5) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) fire damage.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 12
(2d6 + 5) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) fire damage.

***Burning Breath (Recharge 5–6).*** The obsidian minotaur expels a cloud
of superheated gas that fills a 10-foot cube adjacent to it.. The gas fades
after the end of the minotaur’s next turn. Creatures who enter the area
or start their turn there must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw.
On a failed saving throw, the target takes 31 (9d6) fire damage and it is
poisoned for 1 minute. On a successful saving throw, the target takes half
the damage and is not poisoned.
