***False Appearance.*** While the livestone is solidified and remains
motionless, it is indistinguishable from a typical stone.

***Stone Camouflage.*** The livestone has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth)
checks made to hide in rocky terrain.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The livestone makes two attacks with its pseudopod.

***Pseudopod.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If the target is Medium or smaller,
it is grappled (escape DC 15) and restrained until the grapple ends. The
livestone can grapple two targets.

***Engulf.*** The livestone engulfs a Medium or smaller creature grappled
by it. The engulfed target is blinded, restrained, and unable to breathe, and
it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the start of each
of the livestoneâ€™s turns or take 14 (2d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If the
livestone moves, the engulfed target moves with it. The livestone can have
only one creature engulfed at a time.

### Reactions

***Solidify.*** As a reaction, the livestone can solidify all or part of itself into
material with the same consistency of solid rock. The livestone adds 4 to
its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. The livestone does not
have to see the attack to use this ability. A livestone cannot take attack or
move actions if its entire form is solidified. A livestone must use an action
to desolidify itself.
