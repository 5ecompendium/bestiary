***Amphibious.*** The tsathar can breathe air and water.

***Keen Smell.*** The tsathar has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks
that rely on smell.

***Slimy.*** Tsathar continuously cover themselves with muck and slime.
Creatures attempting to grapple a tsathar do so with disadvantage.

***Standing Leap.*** The tsatharâ€™s long jump is up to 20 feet and its high
jump is up to 10 feet, with or without a running start.


***Spellcasting.*** The tsathar sorcerer is a 5th level spellcaster. Its
spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 12, +4 to hit with spell
attacks). It knows the following sorcerer spells:
Cantrips (at will): dancing lights, light, prestidigitation, ray of frost,
shocking grasp

* 1st level (4 slots): <i>fog cloud, magic missile, shield</i>

* 2nd level (3 slots): <i>scorching ray, spider climb</i>

### Actions

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 2
(1d4) piercing damage.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit:
2 (1d4) slashing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13
Constitution saving throw or become the living host to a tsathar egg,
which over the course of the egg maturing, migrates to the chest cavity of
the host. The host creature must make another DC 13 Constitution saving
throw after 24 hours of the egg having been implanted. A failed saving
throw results in the host becoming violently ill, followed by a deep comalike state that lasts 2d6 + 2 days. At the end of each day, the host can
attempt another saving throw with a success indicating that its body has
managed to destroy the egg through normal immune response. At the end
of the incubation period, the host awakes to excruciating pain as the young
tsathar, freed from its egg, tears its way out of the host, who is reduced
to 0 hit points in the process.

A DC 16 Wisdom (Medicine) check can be
attempted to surgically extract an egg from the host. A lesser restoration
spell will also cure the condition and purge the host of the egg.

***Spear.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +2 to hit, reach 5 ft. or 20/60 ft., one
target. Hit: 3 (1d6) piercing damage, or 4 (1d8) piercing damage if used
with two hands to make the melee attack.
