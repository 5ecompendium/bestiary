***Innate Spellcasting.*** The deathlock's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

* At will: <i>detect magic, disguise self, mage armor</i>

***Spellcasting.*** The deathlock is a 10th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks). It regains its expended spell slots when it finishes a short or long rest. It knows the following warlock spells:

* Cantrips (at will): <i>chill touch, mage hand, minor illusion, poison spray</i>

* 5th level (2 slots): <i>arms of Hadar, blight, counterspell, crown of madness, darkness, dimension door, dispel magic, fly, hold monster, invisibility</i>

***Turn Resistance.*** The deathlock has advantage on saving throws against any effect that turns undead.

### Actions

***Deathly Claw*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (3d6 + 3 necrotic damage).

***Grave Bolts*** Ranged Spell Attack: +6 to hit, range 120 ft., one or two targets. Hit: 18 (4d8) necrotic damage. If the target is Large or smaller, it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or become restrained as shadowy tendrils wrap around it for 1 minute. A restrained target can use its action to repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
