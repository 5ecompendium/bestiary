***Magic Resistance.*** The zorbo has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Natural Armor.*** The zorbo magically absorbs the natural strength of its surroundings, adjusting its Armor Class based on the material it is standing or climbing on: AC 15 for wood or bone, AC 17 for earth or stone, or AC 19 for metal. If the zorbo isn't in contact with any of these substances, its AC is 10.

### Actions

***Destructive Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (2d6 +1) slashing damage, and if the target is a creature wearing armor, carrying a shield, or in possession of a magic item that improves its AC , it must make a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, one such item worn or carried by the creature (the target's choice) magically deteriorates, taking a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to the AC it offers, and the zorbo gains a +l bonus to AC until the start of its next turn. Armor reduced to an AC of 10 or a shield or magic item that drops to a 0 AC increase is destroyed.
