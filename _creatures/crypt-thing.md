***Magic Weapons.*** The crypt thing’s weapon attacks are magical.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The crypt thing makes two attacks with its claws.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13
(3d6 + 3) slashing damage and 10 (3d6) necrotic damage.

***Teleport Other (1/day).*** As an action, the crypt thing can teleport all
creatures within 50 feet of it to a randomly determined location. A creature
affected by the crypt thing’s Teleport Other must make a DC 15 Wisdom
saving throw to avoid being teleported.
An affected creature is teleported in a random direction and a random
distance (1d10 x 100 feet) away from the crypt thing. Roll randomly for
each creature that fails its saving throw.
If the affected creature would arrive in a place already occupied by
an object or another creature, the affected creature takes 14 (4d6) force
damage and is not teleported.
