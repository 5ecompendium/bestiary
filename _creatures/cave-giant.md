***Camouflage.*** The giant has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth)
checks to hide in cavernous and rocky underground terrain.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The cave giant makes two greataxe attacks.

***Greataxe.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one
target. Hit: 19 (2d12 + 6) slashing damage.

***Rock.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target.
Hit: 28 (4d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must
succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

### Reactions

***Rock Catching.*** If a rock or similar object is hurled at the giant, the
giant can, with a successful DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, catch the
missile and take no bludgeoning damage from it.
