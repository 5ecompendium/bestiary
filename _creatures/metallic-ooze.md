***False Appearance.*** The metallic ooze is indistinguishable from a pile of
coins as long as it remains motionless.

***Irritating Fumes.*** If a metallic ooze takes fire damage, it emanates a
cloud of semi-transparent vapor that irritates the eyes and respiratory
system of living creatures within 10 feet of it. All creatures other
than undead or constructs within the area must succeed on a DC
15 Constitution saving throw or take 10 (3d6) acid damage and be
poisoned for 1 minute. A poisoned creature can repeat the saving
throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.
The cloud disperses in 1 minute, or can be dispersed by a moderate
or greater wind.

***Spider Climb.*** The metallic ooze can climb difficult surfaces, including
upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

### Actions

***Slam.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12
(2d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 18 (4d8) acid damage, and the target
must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for
1 hour.
