***Fey Ancestry.*** The drow has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put the drow to sleep.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The drow's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma. It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:
* At will: dancing lights
* 1/day each: darkness, faerie fire, levitate (self only)

***Spellcasting.*** The drow is a 11th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Intelligence. It has the following wizard spells prepared:
* Cantrips (at will): mage hand, message, poison spray, shocking grasp, ray of frost
* 1st level (4 slots): burning hands, mage armor, magic missile, shield
* 2nd level (3 slots): gust of wind, invisibility, misty step, shatter
* 3rd level (3 slots): counterspell, fireball, haste
* 4th level (3 slots): dimension door, Otiluke's resilient sphere
* 5th level (2 slots): cone of cold
* 6th level (1 slot): chain lightning

***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** While in sunlight, the drow has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

***War Magic.*** When the drow uses its action to cast a spell, it can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.

### Actions

***Multiattack*** The drow makes three scimitar attacks.

***Scimitar*** Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d6 + 5) slashing damage plus 18 (4d8) poison damage. In addition, the target has disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes against a spell the drow casts before the end of the drow's next turn.

***Hand Crossbow*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d6 + 5) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is also unconscious while poisoned in this way. The target regains consciousness if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it.
