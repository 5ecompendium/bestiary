***Create Gallows Tree Zombie.*** When a creature dies within 15 feet of a
gallows tree, The Gallow’s Tree uses a sharpened tendril to slice open the
creature’s abdomen, thereby spilling the corpse’s innards on the ground. The
organs and fluids are then absorbed by the tree’s roots. Corpses of a size other
than Medium or Large are simply left to rot. Medium or Large corpses are filled
with a greenish pollen fired from one of the tree’s branches. The abdominal
wound heals over the next 1d4 days, at which time the slain creature rises as a
gallows tree zombie connected by a tether-vine to the gallows tree that created
it. Gallows tree zombies possess none of their former abilities.

***Gallows Tree Zombies.*** Each gallows tree has several gallows tree
zombies connected to it. A Huge gallows tree may have no more than
seven gallows tree zombies connected to it at one time. See the gallows
tree zombie entry for details on that monster.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The gallows tree makes three slam attacks.

***Slam.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 28
(6d6 + 7) bludgeoning damage and the target is grappled (escape DC 22)
and restrained.
