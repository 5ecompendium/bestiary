***Freeze.*** If the elemental water dragon takes cold damage, it partially
freezes; its speed is reduced by 20 feet until the end of its next turn.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The dragon’s innate spellcasting ability is
Charisma (spell save DC 18, +10 to hit with spell attacks). It can cast the
following spells, requiring no material components:

* At will: <i>create or destroy water</i>

* 3/day: <i>control water</i>

* 1/day each: <i>control weather, plane shift</i>

***Legendary Resistance (3/day).*** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can
choose to succeed instead.

***Siege Monster.*** The dragon deals double damage to objects and
structures.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The dragon can make three attacks: one with its bite and
two with its claws.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 18
(2d10 + 7) piercing damage.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14
(2d6 + 7) slashing damage.

***Tail.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 16
(2d8 + 7) bludgeoning damage.

***Steam Breath (Recharge 5–6).*** The dragon exhales a 60-foot cone of
superheated steam that spreads around corners. Creatures within the area
must make DC 19 Dexterity saving throws, taking 63 (18d6) fire damage
on a failed saving throw, or half as much on a successful one. Being
underwater does not provide resistance to this effect.

### Bonus Actions

***Drench.*** The elemental water dragon can extinguish any one nonmagical
flame or one magical flame created by a 5th level or lower spell it can see
within 15 feet of it.

### Legendary Actions

The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options
below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only
at the end of another creature’s turn. The dragon regains spent legendary
actions at the start of its turn.

***Detect.*** The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.

***Tail Attack.*** The dragon makes a tail attack.

***Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).*** The dragon beats its wings. Each
creature within 15 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity
saving throw or take 14 (2d6 + 7) bludgeoning damage and be knocked
prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.
