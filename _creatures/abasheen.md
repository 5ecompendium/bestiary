***Air Mastery.*** Airborne creatures attack at disadvantage against abasheen.

***Elemental Demise.*** If the abasheen dies, its body disintegrates into
a warm breeze, leaving behind only the equipment the abasheen was
wearing or carrying.

***Grant Wish.*** The genie can grant one creature’s wish that is within 60
feet of it.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The abasheen’s innate spellcasting ability is
Intelligence (spell save DC 15, +7 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately
cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

* At will: <i>command, charm person, plane shift </i>(willing targets to elemental planes, Astral Plane, or Material Plane only)

* 1/day: <i>geas</i>

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The abasheen makes two attacks with its falchion.

***Falchion.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit:
12 (2d8 + 3) slashing damage.

***Thunderclap (Recharge 5–6).*** The abasheen claps its hands together
loudly, and a wave of thundering force emanates out from it in a 30-foot
radius. Each creature in this area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving
throw or be pushed back 10 feet and take 18 (4d8) thunder damage on a
failed save, or half as much damage with no pushback on a successful one.
