***Barbed Hide.*** At the start of each of its turns, the barbed devil deals 5 (1d10) piercing damage to any creature grappling it.

***Devil's Sight.*** Magical darkness doesn't impede the devil's darkvision.

***Magic Resistance.*** The devil has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The devil makes three melee attacks: one with its tail and two with its claws. Alternatively, it can use Hurl Flame twice.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft ., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage.

***Tail.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage.
